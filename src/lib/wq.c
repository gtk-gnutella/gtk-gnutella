 *
 * Wait queue -- fires callback when waiting event is released.
 *
 * When an asynchronous processing is waiting on something to happen to
 * continue its processing, it can register itself in the wait queue, along
 * with a "key", an opaque value used to identify the event being waited for.
 *
 * When events occur, they wakeup the queue so that anybody registered as
 * waiting on the event can attempt to resume its processing.
 *
 * This brings the equivalent of sleep() / wakeup() to asynchronous processing,
 * albeit the context of the operation needs to be kept explicitly in an object
 * as opposed to being held on the stack.
 *
 * Waiting requests are ordered, on a first come first served basis (FIFO).
 * At wakeup time, callbacks inform the queue dispatching logic about their
 * wakeup fate: it was a success (WQ_REMOVE: the event was useful, waiting is
 * over), or a failure (WQ_SLEEP: the event was useless, waiting is resumed).
 * The wakeup callback can also inform the dispatching logic about the
 * usefulness of continuing to invoke wakeup callbacks for the event.
 * For instance, if one is waiting for a semaphore and grabs it, there is no
 * need to continue waking up other interested parties since there is no
 * chance they will be able to grab it (WQ_EXCLUSIVE: do not wakeup anyone
 * else).
 *
 * It is possible to sleep() with a configured timeout, in which case the
 * wakeup callback is invoked with a special wakeup value (WQ_TIMED_OUT)
 * which the callback must handle explicitly.  If it returns WQ_SLEEP, the
 * timeout is re-armed and waiting continues.  If it returns WQ_REMOVE the
 * wait operation is cancelled.
 *
 * The data structures used to manage the wait queue are straightforward:
 *
 * - The waitqueue hash table maps a "key" to the list of parties that are
 *   waiting on the event.
 * - The waiting list is a hashlist, to keep it ordered, yet allow random
 *   access to any item for easy removal of entries.
