/**
 * @ingroup lib
 * @file
 *
 * Simple Pseudo-Random Number Generation (PRNG) engine.
 *
 * This engine should not be used when strong random numbers are necessary.
 * It is only meant to produce a simple source of randomness for tests, or
 * to bootstrap stronger engines.
 *
 * It generates 31-bit random numbers via an interface compatible with the
 * rand() C library function, only we append "31" at the tail to distinguish
 * rand31() from the standard routine, and also emphasize the limited range
 * of the random numbers we produce.
 *
 * When a sequence of random numbers yields an interesting result, it is
 * possible to replay it by querying the original random seed.  The only catch
 * is that the number 0 is not a valid seed for rand31_set_seed(), as it
 * requests the computation of a new random seed.  Given this PRNG is only
 * meant for tests and not for serious random numbers, this is not deemed a
 * problem, only bad luck.
 *
 * To (slowly) generate strong random numbers, use entropy_random().
 * For (faster) strong random numbers, use arc4random().

	 *     seed * 1103515245 + 12345
	 *
	 * which is less than optimal and does not vary much with
	 * the original seed.  On 2015-11-21, we've switched to a
	 * better algorithm:
	 *
	 *     seed * 7^5 mod 2^31-1
	 *
	 * Because p=2^31-1 is a prime number, Z/pZ is a field, so
	 * we're guaranteed to loop over all the numbers, once, as
	 * long as the initial seed is not zero!
	 *
	 * This algorithm was first described in:
	 *
	 * "Random number generators: good ones are hard to find",
	 * by Park and Miller, Communications of the ACM, vol. 31,
	 * no. 10, p. 1195, October 1988.
	 *
	 * To perform the computation witout overflowing the 31 bits,
	 * and to avoid performing any division to take the modulo,
	 * we are using Robin Whittle's implementation, which is derived
	 * from the following article:
	 *
	 * "Two Fast Implementations of the 'Minimal Standard' Random
	 * Number Generator", by David G. Carta, Communications of the
	 * ACM, vol. 33, no. 1, p. 87-88, January 1990.
	 *
	 * This rand31() remains a weak generator from a statistical
	 * perspective, but it makes our rand31_u32() a decent one.
	 *
	 * Note that the generated numbers fall between 1 and 2^31 - 2,
	 * since 0 is avoided and 2^31 - 1 is the modulo, hence attempting
	 * uniform distribution via random_upto() will yield biased results.
