 * Exit wrapper.
 *
 * Our own exit() wrapper makes sure anything allocated by the libc startup
 * will not be freed, as it could not have proper block sizes when xmalloc()
 * supersedes malloc(): at startup time, we had no chance to initialize the
 * necessary constants to compute page size alignments.
 *
 * They suspend the other threads to avoid problems and parasite logging as
 * we reclaim important resources during signal_perform_cleanup().
