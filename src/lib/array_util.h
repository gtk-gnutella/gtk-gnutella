 *
 * Low-level array insertion and removal macros.
 *
 * These macros are used to insert, remove or make room for insertion at
 * a given array index.  The array is simply a plain memory region storing
 * each item contiguously in slots, all slots being equally-sized.
 *
 * There is no metadata attached to these arrays, which is why the macros
 * defined here all take a size parameter to specify how many items are held
 * in the memory region.
 *
 * Using these macros to handle insertion and removal from arrays factorizes
 * code and prevents typos, since some consistency is required between the
 * array name and the sizeof() call for instance.  They also add assertions to
 * dynamically ensure that the indices are correct with respect to the array
 * shape (capacity or current amount of items).
