 * Structural equivalence guarantees that we can use an extended event as
 * a regular event as long as we don't need to access the extra fields.
 *
 * An extended event is created by cq_insert() (or any wrapping convenience
 * routine) when the caller is not the thread that runs the queue, and the
 * caller will need to keep a reference on the created event.
 *
 * The caller will need to explictly call cq_cancel() to free the event,
 * regardless of whether it was already scheduled, unless it does not call
 * cq_zero(), in which case it will be freed upon return.  This would happen
 * if the caller does not (need to) remember the value returned by cq_insert().

 * @struct cqueue
 *
 * Callout queue descriptor.
 *
 * A callout queue is really a sorted linked list of events that are to
 * happen in the near future, most recent coming first.
 *
 * Naturally, the insertion/deletion of items has to be relatively efficient.
 * We don't want to go through all the items in the list to find the proper
 * position for insertion.
 *
 * To do that, we maintain a parallel hash list of all the events, each event
 * being inserted in the bucket i, where i is computed by abs_time % size,
 * abs_time being the absolute time where the event is to be triggered
 * and size being the size of the hash list. All the items under the bucket
 * list are further sorted by increasing trigger time.
 *
 * To be completely generic, the callout queue "absolute time" is a mere
 * unsigned long value. It can represent an amount of ms, or an amount of
 * yet-to-come messages, or whatever. We don't care, and we don't want to care.
 * The notion of "current time" is simply given by calling cq_clock() at
 * regular intervals and giving it the "elasped time" since the last call.
