This version of sdbm merely has all the dbm_* names translated to sdbm_*
so that we can link ndbm and sdbm into the same executable.  (It also has
the bad() macro redefined to allow a zero-length key.)

sdbm_exists added to the library by Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>.

Taken out of the Perl 5.10.0 distribution in /ext/SDBM_File/sdbm by
Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com> and slightly adapted
for inclusion in gtk-gnutella.

The file sdbm.h was heavily edited to remove perl-isms, and the sdbm.c
file changed slightly to add gtk-gnutella-isms.

The standalone C programs do not compile as-is but were left to keep the
integrity of the original sdbm distribution.

Christian Biere brought up SDBM distribution to gtk-gnutella standards.

 * Prefixed all public SDBM macros with "DBM_".
 * Removed "register" keyword.
 * Removed unnecessary "(void)" in front of function calls.
 * struct DBM:
   * Keep implementation details hidden in sdbm.c.
   * Sorted members by size for compactness.
   * Allocate extra buffers for pagbuf and dirbuf
     because the code expects these to be aligned
     for "short int".
 * Replaced macros by (static inline) functions where possible.
 * Removed comma-operator. This should be reserved to macros
   or the like where it may be necessary and not used to save
   lines or look fancy.
 * sdbm_store(): val.dptr must be a valid pointer and non-NULL
   because the internal code uses memcpy() etc. without further
   checks.
 * Added sdbm_is_storable() to avoid integer overflows when
   calculating the required space.
 * sdbm_open():
   * Compose the filenames properly.
   * Additional file type and size checks.

Changes from Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>:

* Fixed bug in getnext(), which flagged an I/O error when iterating over
  an empty database.
* Indented all comments within a function to match general gtk-gnutella style.
* Added trailing vi comments for VIM.

Changes from Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>:

* Factorized page reading and flushing into fetch_pagbuf() and flush_pagbuf().
* All functions returning a boolean had their return type changed from int
  to gboolean to make that explicit.  Constants TRUE and FALSE replace 1 and 0.
* Protected getnext() against DB modifications during the key traversal. This
  is forbidden and will now trigger an assertion failure.
* Enhanced chkpage() to ensure ino[0] is always an even number and that offsets
  never point within the ino[] zone.
* Added sdbm_deletekey() to delete the current key during traversals.
* Added getnval() to get the n-th value from current page and sdbm_value() to
  return the current value during key iteration.
* Added sdbm_set_name() and sdbm_name(), for logging purposes.
* Call g_warning() unconditionally on low-level I/O errors to leave a trail
  when things start to go wrong.

Changes from Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>:

* Modified dba's output to show the space used by keys and values, and to
  highlight pages with low free space (unable to add a new key/value pair,
  given the average size of the existing entries on the page).
* Added LRU page cache, activated via "tune.h".
* Added statistics counters and final logging for:
  - amount of page reads and writes
  - amount of dir reads and writes
  - amount of block number hits for page and dir (accesses to current page)
  - amount of LRU page read cache hits (when LRU is activated)
  - amount of LRU page write cache hits (when LRU write-back is activated)
