<h2>General</h2>

<h3><a name="general0">What is gnutella anyway?</a></h3>
<p>
  Gnutella is a decentralized Peer to Peer information exchanging network. At
  the moment you can publish and download files of any kind using the Gnutella
  network.  For more information, visit the
  <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnutella"
  >Wikipedia definition of Gnutella</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="general-gtkg">What is "GTKG?"</a></h3>
<p>
  We often refer to gtk-gnutella as GTKG or gtkg (because it's shorter). GTK
  comes from GTK+ which is the graphical toolkit used by gtk-gnutella.
</p>

<h3><a name="general1">This eats up too much bandwidth!</a></h3>
<p>
  At the moment you can try one or more of the following things if you are a user
  on a slow line (modem):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Run as a leaf node. You change the peermode setting in the configuration
    panel under GnutellaNet. An icon in the statusbar indicates in which mode
    you are running.
  </li>
  <li>
    Limit the number of gnet connections you have.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are able to receive incoming connections, enable <em>Prefer
    compressed connections</em> in the <em>Bandwidth</em>
    options.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if you are on a slow connection, it's still important to share
    files.  With <a href="#down3">swarming</a>, people can upload small chunks
    of files from you, so even a slow connection, multiplied by many sources on
    the gnet, makes a tremendous contribution.  If you have a 56K modem, you
    can set <em>Bandwidth limits for HTTP traffic</em> - <em>Cumulative upload
    rate</em> to 1K/s so you still have the majority of your bandwidth for
    downloading.
  </li>
  <li>
    Depress the lower-left button in the GUI after your downloads have started.
    This will disconnect from the Gnutella network.  We strongly advise you to NOT
    do that. You won't be able to get more alternate locations from the net and
    people won't be able to search your files.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="general-ultrapeer">What are Ultrapeers and Leaf nodes?</a></h3>
<p>
  Since version 0.92, gtk-gnutella has implemented
  <a href="?page=features"><em>ultrapeers</em></a> and
  <em>leaf nodes</em>.
  This divides servents on the gnet into leaf nodes, which connect only to
  ultrapeers, and ultrapeers, which connect to many leaf nodes and a small
  number of other ultrapeers (see
  <a href="#gnet0">What is a good number of connections?</a>).
</p>
<p>
  Ultrapeers must not be not firewalled, are expected to have long uptimes
  (more than two hours), and have sufficient surplus bandwidth to donate to
  the gnet.  Ultrapeers forward queries from their leaf nodes and leaf nodes
  upload to their ultrapeers
  <a href="?page=features">QRP</a>
  tables which contain hashes of keywords that will match files shared by the 
  leaf.  When an ultrapeer gets a hit on a query routing table, it relays the 
  query to the corresponding leaf node.  The result is very low gnet traffic 
  for each leaf node, freeing bandwidth for sharing and downloading (which 
  still occur directly p2p.)  Ultrapeers can also act as
  <a href="?page=features">push-proxies</a> for
  firewalled leaf nodes.
</p>

<h3><a name="general-firewall">Why does gtk-gnutella claim it's firewalled
  when it's not?</a>
</h3>

<p>
gtk-gnutella needs to receive an incoming connection to determine if you
can be reached from the outside. Until then, it's assumed that there's
a firewall which blocks the configured listening TCP port.
If you want to speed up the detection, use a web browser, telnet or similar
and connect to the listening port from the outside. If the connection is
refused or dropped, then you are very probably really unreachable due to a
firewall which blocks the port, a misconfigured NAT or similar. You might
want to try a different listening TCP port because some ISPs block the
default Gnutella port (6346).

<a href="#gnet1"><q>Do I need to forward a port on my firewall?</q></a>.
</p>

<h2>Building from source</h2>

<h3><a name="build1">How do I make Configure stop asking me all those questions?</a></h3>
<p>
  You can run the <code>Configure</code> script in the following way to make it
  use the default settings. It then behaves as calling the old
  <code>configure</code> script from autoconf did back in the old days.
</p>
<p>
  <code>$ ./Configure -ders</code>
</p>
<p>
  You can set compile options on the command line too. Here is an example
  that will configure gtk-gnutella to
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    accept custom settings (<code>-O</code>). Without this all the
    parameters below won't have an effect.
  </li>
  <li>
     use the Gtk1 frontend, activate the remote shell
     (<code>-D gtkversion=1 -D remotectrl=y</code>)
  </li>
  <li>
    compile for a pentium with MMX support
    (<code>-Dccflags="-march=pentium -mmmx"</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    compile in debugging information while turning off all compiler
    optimizations (<code>-Doptimize="-g -O0"</code>).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <code>$ ./Configure -ders -O -D gtkversion=1 -D remotectrl=y -Dccflags="-march=pentium -mmmx" -Doptimize="-g -O0"</code>
</p>

<h2>Gnutella connections</h2>

<h3><a name="gnet0">What is a good number of connections?</a></h3>
<p>
  In <a href="#general-ultrapeer">leaf</a> mode 3 ultrapeers, in
  <a href="#general-ultrapeer">ultrapeer</a> mode 32/40 (minimum/maximum)
  ultrapeers and around 100 leaf nodes. The actual number should depend on the 
  available bandwidth. If you have set "Prefer compressed connections," bandwidth
  used will be much lower. You should never use up all your bandwidth with
  gnet connections. Especially on an asymmetric cable/DSL connection you can
  easily starve your incoming traffic by producing too much outgoing traffic
  (TCP/IP issue). Use at most half of your outgoing bandwidth for gnet
  connections.
</p>
<p>
  Since the adoption of "high outdegree" in version 0.95 you should have 
  32/40 connections to other ultrapeers. The number
  of leaf connections to use depends on your bandwidth and the speed of your
  cpu.  As an absolute minimum an ultrapeer should connect to 20 leaf nodes
  and it's much better to connect to 100 or more.  Watch the bandwidth
  odometers on the lower left of the gui and use the top command to keep track
  of cpu usage.  Increase the number of leaf connections until you reach the
  maximum amount of bandwidth and system resources you wish to devote to this
  purpose.
</p>
<p>
  The bandwidth control settings will help you further fine-tune
  gtk-gnutella's bandwidth usage.
</p>

<h3><a name="gnet1">Do I need to forward a port on my firewall?</a></h3>
<p>
  You don't need to forward any ports for gtk-gnutella to work, but it
  will perform much better if you do. If gtk-gnutella thinks you are
  firewalled, it will not show any <a href="#down_push">"push"</a> results since
  you wouldn't be able to download those anyway.<br>
  Even when people cannot connect directly to you, they can still download
  files from your node using a <a href="#down_push">push request</a>.<br>
  You can configure the port gtk-gnutella listens on. The setting
  <em>Listen port</em> is located in the <em>File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Network</em>.
</p>
 
<h3><a name="gnet-forward-howto">How do I configure port forwarding?</a></h3>
<p>
  You can find instructions for most popular routers at
  <a href="http://www.portforward.com/routers.htm">http://www.portforward.com/routers.htm</a>. Try
  <a href="http://www.canyouseeme.org/">http://www.canyouseeme.org/</a>
  to check your port forwarding.
</p>

<h3><a name="gnet-udp">Does gtk-gnutella use UDP?</a></h3>
<p>
  Yes, starting with version 0.95 gtk-gnutella can also use 
  <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc768.html">UDP</a> in addition
  to <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc793.html">TCP</a>.  
</p>

<h3><a name="gnet2">What does "[FC]" mean?</a></h3>
<p>
  The <em>FC</em> means "flow control".<br>
  In general, you should make sure that servents to which you are connected do
  not flow control.  Watch for the trailing <em>[FC]</em> indication at
  the end of the <em>Info</em> string (you may need to drag the right
  edge past the window to trigger the underlying scroll bar), or look at the
  FC state in the <a href="#gnet4">Flags</a> column. As a rule of thumb, if
  you have more than one node flow-controlling at a given time, you don't have
  enough outgoing bandwidth dedicated to gnet, and therefore you are harming
  the network: either decrease the amount of connections, enable the
  <em>Prefer compressed connections</em> option or raise the outgoing
  bandwidth limit.
</p>

<h3><a name="gnet3">Why do I lose gnet connections when I have an upload?</a></h3>
<p>
  Try to do bandwidth limiting. If that doesn't help, maybe your provider throttles
  gnutella traffic. Try changing your gnutella port in the network settings of
  gtk-gnutella.
</p>

<h3><a name="gnet4">What does the stuff in the Flags column mean?</a></h3>
<p>
  You can see the type and some of the settings of a connection here.  Note
  push-proxies are implemented in 0.92.1c and later.
</p>

</pre>

<h3><a name="gnet-user-agent">What's the meaning of a leading "!" in the User-Agent name?</a></h3>
<p>
  This indicates that the User-Agent name is <em>possibly</em> faked but
  it could be a false-positive caused by a bad clock on either side.
</p>

<h3><a name="gnet5">What does "Harmful version banned, upgrade required" mean?</a></h3>
<p>
  Sometimes, servents are discovered to have a bug or behaviour that is harmful
  to the gnet.  For example, gtk-gnutella-0.92b had a bug that generated excessive
  queries which hammered on the <a href="?page=gwebcache">GWebCache system</a>.
  Such banning is exceptional, usually restricted to specific versions, and the
  servent's author is informed about the banning.
</p>

<h3><a name="gnet6">What does "Outdated version, please upgrade" mean?</a></h3>
<p>
  It is important to upgrade versions of gtk-gnutella which are older than one
  year since they lack features that are important to the rapidly evolving
  gnet's health and scalability.  In addition, unstable versions are banned 
  after 90 days.
</p>

<h3><a name="gnet7">Why doesn't my HTTP proxy work?</a></h3>
<p>
  Your HTTP proxy must support the method <code>CONNECT</code> because a normal <code>GET</code>
  doesn't work with Gnutella connections. This is an extension to the HTTP
  protocol and mainly supported by SQUID proxies. It's also often deactivated
  because it might be considered a security problem by your provider. At the
  moment, the proxy support - also for SOCKS - isn't very good. The developers
  don't use proxies but if you think you can fix it, we would appreciate
  your patches.
</p>

<h3><a name="gnet8">How can I increase the timeouts?</a></h3>
<p>
  If your internet connection suffers from high latency it might help to
  increase the timeouts. Go to <em>File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;User Interface</em>
  and tick <em>Expert mode</em>.
  Now, you'll find a lot more settings to change when you go to
  <em>File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Gnutella</em>.
</p>

<h3><a name="gnet-auto">How does auto mode decide between ultra and leaf?</a></h3>
<p>
  In order to be promoted to <a href="#general-ultrapeer">ultra mode</a> the 
  following conditions must be met:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    There must be more than 8192 bytes/s outgoing bandwidth available.
  </li>
  <li>
    If bandwidth schedulers are enabled, leaf nodes must not be configured to 
    steal all the HTTP outgoing bandwidth.
  </li>
  <li>
    If Gnet out scheduler is enabled, there must be at least 256 bytes/s per 
    gnet connection (ultrapeer or normal aka legacy).
  </li>
  <li>
    Overall, there must be 32 bytes/s per configured leaf plus 256 bytes/s per 
    gnet connection available.
  </li>
</ol>
  
<h2>Searches</h2>

<h3><a name="search0">How can I get more results?</a></h3>
<p>
  The number of results you get depends heavily on whether people are able to
  connect to you (see <a href="#gnet1">port forwarding</a>)
  and on the <a href="#gnet0">number of connections</a> to other hosts.
</p>

<h3><a name="search3">How can I ignore files with no SHA1?</a></h3>
<p>
  Click with right mouse button on a search result without a SHA1 and
  select "Drop results...-&gt;with the same urn:sha1" from the popup menu.
  That will drop all results with this SHA1 - in this case none - from your
  results. You'll miss a lot of spam.
</p>

<h3><a name="search-entry">Where did the search entry box go?</a></h3>
<p>
  Searches are now entered in the <q><em>Search:</em></q> box in the sidebar.
</p>

<h3><a name="search-passive">What are "Passive" searches?</a></h3>
<p>
  A <q><em>passive</em></q> search will return all the search results that 
  pass through gtk-gnutella.  By 
  <a href="?page=filtering_howto">filtering</a> these results,
  passive searches can be useful.  
</p>
<p>
  If you are in <a href="#general-ultrapeer">ultra</a> mode, many search 
  results are already passing through your node besides the ones for your own 
  searches. You can take advantage of this to make searches without generating 
  any extra gnet traffic.  For example, on my ultrapeer with 200 
  <a href="#general-ultrapeer">leaf nodes</a>, I opened a passive search and 
  filtered the results to display only hits with the name 
  <q><em>linux</em></q>.  Within an hour or so I had about 1500 results. 
  Obviously, the more popular the search, and the more patient you are, the 
  more useful this technique is.
</p>
<p>
  If you are in leaf mode, then the only search results that will pass through 
  gtk-gnutella will be those from your own searches, so the above technique 
  won't be useful.  But there is another way to use passive searches that is 
  only useful in leaf mode.  For example, if you start a passive search and 
  filter it to display only mp3 files, then all mp3 files from all your open 
  searches will be conveniently aggregated in one search window.  By opening 
  more passive searches with different filters, you can display different 
  file types in each.
</p>

<h2>Downloads</h2>

<h3><a name="down0">What does the status "Ignoring requested [SHA1|name &amp; size]" mean?</a></h3>
<p>
  This means that gtk-gnutella has that file recorded as complete in its
  database. This database is usually located in
  <code>~/.gtk-gnutella/done.sha1</code> and <code>~/.gtk-gnutella/done.namesize</code>.
  At the moment, there is no way to remove or modify
  an entry of that database from the gui, but you can edit the file with any
  text editor while gtk-gnutella is not running. If you add or remove something
  from one of the files, do the same to the other.
</p>

<h3><a name="down1">What does the status "No URN on server" mean?</a></h3>
<p>
  This means that gtk-gnutella wants to download a new file from a host, but
  that host does not provide a SHA1 hash for the file. Since the file is new
  (not yet partially downloaded), gtk-gnutella cannot do an overlap check to
  verify that the file on the host is really the file you want. In such a case
  it relies on the SHA1 provided by the remote host, but if no SHA1 is
  supplied, then gtk-gnutella has no way of assuring that the file it wants to
  download and the file on the remote server are really the same.<br>
  If you get annoyed by those messages you can activate the <em>Optimistic
  first chunk</em> option in <em>File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Downloads</em> 
  (first you'll need to go to <em>Settings->Preferences->User Interface</em>
  and tick <em>Expert mode</em>).
</p>

<h3><a name="down2">Why is the same file downloaded X times?</a></h3>
<p>
  Check the <em>Range</em> column. This is called
  <a href="#down3">swarming</a>.  gtk-gnutella tries to get the file in
  <a href="#down4">chunks</a> and will get it from multiple hosts in parallel,
  if possible.
</p>

<h3><a name="down3">What is "swarming"?</a></h3>
<p>
  Swarming describes the ability to download a single file from multiple hosts
  in parallel. gtk-gnutella will automatically try to find additional sources
  for any queued file using the <a href="#down5">download mesh</a> and by
  monitoring routed results.
</p>

<h3><a name="down4">What is a "chunk"?</a></h3>
<p>
  A <em>chunk</em> is another word for <em>part of a file</em>. When gtk-gnutella runs in
  <a href="#down3">swarming mode</a> it will retrieve multiple chunks of a
  downloading file until it has downloaded the complete file. The
  <em>Range</em> column shows you which chunk you are currently
  downloading.
</p>

<h3><a name="down5">What is the "download mesh"?</a></h3>
<p>
  When you download a file from a host that supports the download mesh,
  it will tell you about additional sources for the requested file
  (provided it knows of any). Those will then be used for
  <a href="#down3">swarming</a>
</p>

<h3><a name="down_push">What is a "push request"?</a></h3>
<p>
  The <em>push request</em> is a facility to download files from hosts you cannot
  connect to directly (because they are firewalled). Well, you cannot
  connect to those hosts, but they probably can connect to you. To
  tell a remote host to connect to your host so that you can download
  a file from the remote host you send a push request to it.<br>
  If you download a file using a push request and you loose contact to
  the host which originally returned the result for that file to you,
  then the <em>push route</em> is lost and you can no longer download this
  file.
  Therefore push routes are quite fragile.
  You can't make use of push requests when you are behind a firewall
  (see <a href="#gnet1">port forwarding</a>).
</p>

<h3><a name="down7">Why does gtk-gnutella append a .OK to my file names?</a></h3>
<p>
  You probably haven't set up different directories for downloaded files,
  temporary files and bad files.
</p>

<h3><a name="down8">I got a file that just won't download!</a></h3>
<p>
  If you don't see a smiling yellow icon with sunglasses in the statusbar, you
  should try to change that. See the section about
  <a href="#gnet1">firewalls</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Otherwise if gtk-gnutella says it has only a few sources for the file
  (best seen in the fileinfo subtab in the downloads pane) then this can have
  two reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the file is a rare one</li>
  <li>
    You selected a version of the file that is unique. Chances are that there
    may be a more common version. A file can become unique e.g. when somebody
    changes the mp3info on an mp3 file or otherwise does some custom
    modification to the file.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You can try to search for the file again and see if you find another version
  which is more common. It's usually a good indication if the "#" shows a
  number for a file. The larger the number, the better are the chances that
  you can get it quickly.
</p>

<h3><a name="down9">In the downloads pane, what does it mean if the color of
  the text is grey instead of black?</a></h3>
<p>
  It means that the file is received over a <a href="#down_push">push route</a>.
</p>

<h2>Uploads</h2>

<h3><a name="up0">What does "Normalized" mean?</a></h3>
<p>
  This shows the total amount of bytes uploaded for the file divided by the
  file size.
</p>

<h2>GTK+ 2.x</h2>

<h3><a name="gtk2_slow">Gtk2 is way sloooow.</a></h3>
<p>
  Set the environment variable <code>GDK_USE_XFT</code> to 0 and see whether
  this helps. This turns off anti aliasing in Gtk2 which can use a lot of cpu.
  The Gtk2 frontend is much slower than the Gtk1 frontend. So on a slow machine,
  you should consider using the Gtk1 frontend.
</p>


<h3><a name="gtk2_ctype">Non-ASCII characters show up as _ (underscore).</a></h3>
<p>
  Set the environment variable <code>LC_CTYPE</code> or <code>LC_ALL</code> to
  an appropriate value for the encoding you use. For example, if you use
  special German characters in your filenames, set it to
  <code>de_DE.ISO8859-1</code>. The valid values depend on your operating
  system, see the manpage setlocale(3) for details. Ideally, everyone would
  use UTF-8 encoding which covers nearly all languages.
