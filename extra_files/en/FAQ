<h2>General</h2>
    <h3><a name="general0">What is gnutella anyway?</a></h3>
    <p>Gnutella is a decentralized Peer to Peer information exchanging network.
      At the moment you can publish and download files of any kind using the
      Gnutella network. For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnutella">Wikipedia
        definition of Gnutella</a>.</p>
        
    <h3><a name="general-G2">And what about G2?</a></h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnutella2">G2</a> is a
      peer-to-peer protocol inspired by Gnutella, developed mainly by Michael
      Stokes and released in 2002 in the <a href="http://shareaza.sourceforge.net/">Shareaza</a>
      client for the Windows operating system. Starting with version 1.1, gtkg
      can connect to that network as a leaf and so search and share files on G2
      in addition to Gnutella. The equivalents of <a href="#general-ultrapeer">ultrapeers</a>
      are called <em>hubs</em> on the G2 network.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="general-gtkg">What is GTKG?</a></h3>
    <p>We often refer to gtk-gnutella as GTKG or gtkg (because it's shorter).
      GTK comes from GTK+ which is the graphical toolkit used by gtk-gnutella.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="general1">This eats up too much bandwidth!</a></h3>
    <p>At the moment you can try one or more of the following things if you are
      a user on a slow line:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Run as a leaf node. You change the peermode setting in the
        configuration panel under GnutellaNet. An icon in the statusbar
        indicates in which mode you are running.</li>
        <li>Limit the number of gnet connections you have.</li>
        <li>If you are able to receive incoming connections, enable <em>Prefer
          compressed connections</em> in the <em>Bandwidth</em> options.</li>
        <li>Even if you are on a slow connection, it's still important to share
        files. With <a href="#down3">swarming</a>, people can upload small
        chunks of files from you, so even a slow connection, multiplied by many
        sources on the gnet, makes a tremendous contribution.
        Setting <em>Bandwidth limits for HTTP traffic</em> - <em>Cumulative
          upload rate</em> up to 50% of your available outboing bandwidth should not affect
          your web experience.</li>
          <li>If you are behind an ADSL router consider configuring <em>Quality of Service</em> (QoS) in order
          to optimally distribute the available bandwidth following customizable rules.</li>
        <li>Depress the lower-left button in the GUI after your downloads have
        started. This will disconnect from the Gnutella network. We strongly
        advise you to NOT do that. You won't be able to get more alternate
        locations from the net and people won't be able to search your files.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><a name="general-ultrapeer">What are Ultrapeers and Leaf nodes?</a></h3>
    <p>Since version 0.92, gtk-gnutella has implemented <em>ultrapeers</em>
      and <em>leaf nodes</em>. This divides servents on the gnet into leaf
      nodes, which connect only to ultrapeers, and ultrapeers, which connect to
      many leaf nodes and a small number of other ultrapeers (see <a href="#gnet0">What
        is a good number of connections?</a>).</p>
    <p>Ultrapeers must not be not firewalled, are expected to have long uptimes
      (more than two hours), and have sufficient surplus bandwidth to donate to
      the gnet. Ultrapeers forward queries from their leaf nodes and leaf nodes
      upload to their ultrapeers QRP tables which contain hashes of keywords
      that will match files shared by the leaf. When an ultrapeer gets a hit on
      a query routing table, it relays the query to the corresponding leaf node.
      The result is very low gnet traffic for each leaf node, freeing bandwidth
      for sharing and downloading (which still occur directly p2p.) Ultrapeers
      can also act as <a href="#down_push">push-proxies</a> for firewalled leaf
      nodes.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="general-firewall">Why does gtk-gnutella claim it's firewalled
        when it's not?</a></h3>
    <p>gtk-gnutella needs to receive an incoming connection to determine if you
      can be reached from the outside. Until then, it's assumed that there's a
      firewall which blocks the configured listening TCP port. If you want to
      speed up the detection, use a web browser, telnet or similar and connect
      to the listening port from the outside. If the connection is refused or
      dropped, then you are very probably really unreachable due to a firewall
      which blocks the port, a misconfigured NAT or similar. You might want to
      try a different listening TCP port because some ISPs block the default
      Gnutella port (6346). See also, <a href="#gnet1"><q>Do I need to forward
          a port on my firewall?</q></a>.</p>


    <h2>Building from source</h2>
    
    <h3><a name="build1">How do I make Configure stop asking me all those
        questions?</a></h3>
    <p>You can run the <code>Configure</code> script in the following way to
      make it use the default settings. It then behaves as calling the old <code>configure</code>
      script from autoconf did back in the old days.</p>
    <p><code>$ ./Configure -ders</code></p>
    <p>You can set compile options on the command line too. Here is an example
      that will configure gtk-gnutella to</p>
    <ul>
        <li>accept custom settings (<code>-O</code>). Without this all the
        parameters below won't have an effect.</li>
        <li>use the Gtk1 frontend, activate the remote shell (<code>-D
          gtkversion=1 -D remotectrl=y</code>)</li>
        <li>compile for a pentium with MMX support (<code>-Dccflags="-march=pentium
          -mmmx"</code>).</li>
        <li>compile in debugging information while turning off all compiler
        optimizations (<code>-Doptimize="-g -O0"</code>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><code>$ ./Configure -ders -O -D gtkversion=1 -D remotectrl=y
        -Dccflags="-march=pentium -mmmx" -Doptimize="-g -O0"</code></p>
        
        
    <h2>Gnutella connections</h2>
    
    <h3><a name="gnet0">What is a good number of connections?</a></h3>
    <p>In <a href="#general-ultrapeer">leaf</a> mode 4 ultrapeers, in <a href="#general-ultrapeer">ultrapeer</a>
      mode 32/50 (minimum/maximum) ultrapeers and at least 100 leaf nodes. The
      actual number should depend on the available bandwidth. If you have set
      "Prefer compressed connections," bandwidth used will be much lower. You
      should never use up all your bandwidth with gnet connections. Especially
      on an asymmetric cable/DSL connection you can easily starve your incoming
      traffic by producing too much outgoing traffic (TCP/IP issue). Use at most
      half of your outgoing bandwidth for gnet connections.</p>
    <p>Since the adoption of "high outdegree" in version 0.95 you should have
      32/50 connections to other ultrapeers. The number of leaf connections to
      use depends on your bandwidth and the speed of your cpu. As an absolute
      minimum an ultrapeer should connect to 20 leaf nodes and it's much better
      to connect to 100 or more. Watch the bandwidth odometers on the lower left
      of the gui and use the top command to keep track of cpu usage. Increase
      the number of leaf connections until you reach the maximum amount of
      bandwidth and system resources you wish to devote to this purpose.</p>
    <p>The bandwidth control settings will help you further fine-tune
      gtk-gnutella's bandwidth usage.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="gnet1">Do I need to forward a port on my firewall?</a></h3>
    <p>You don't need to forward any ports for gtk-gnutella to work, but it
      will perform much better if you do. If gtk-gnutella thinks you are
      firewalled, it will not show any <a href="#down_push">"push"</a> results
      since you wouldn't be able to download those anyway.<br>Even when people cannot connect directly to you, they can still download
      files from your node using a <a href="#down_push">push request</a>.<br>You can configure the port gtk-gnutella listens on. The setting <em>Listen
        port</em> is located in the <em>File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Network</em>.</p>
        
    <h3><a name="gnet-forward-howto">How do I configure port forwarding?</a></h3>
    <p>You can find instructions for most popular routers at <a href="http://www.portforward.com/routers.htm">http://www.portforward.com/routers.htm</a>.
      Try <a href="http://www.canyouseeme.org/">http://www.canyouseeme.org/</a>
      to check your port forwarding.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="gnet-udp">Does gtk-gnutella use UDP?</a></h3>
    <p>Yes, starting with version 0.95 gtk-gnutella can also use <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc768.html">UDP</a>
      in addition to <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc793.html">TCP</a>.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="gnet2">What does "[FC]" mean?</a></h3>
    <p>The <em>FC</em> means "flow control".<br>In general, you should make sure that servents to which you are connected
      do not flow control. Watch for the trailing <em>[FC]</em> indication at
      the end of the <em>Info</em> string (you may need to drag the right edge
      past the window to trigger the underlying scroll bar), or look at the FC
      state in the <a href="#gnet4">Flags</a> column. As a rule of thumb, if
      you have more than one node flow-controlling at a given time, you don't
      have enough outgoing bandwidth dedicated to gnet, and therefore you are
      harming the network: either decrease the amount of connections, enable the
      <em>Prefer compressed connections</em> option or raise the outgoing
      bandwidth limit.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="gnet3">Why do I lose gnet connections when I have an upload?</a></h3>
    <p>Try to do bandwidth limiting. If that doesn't help, maybe your provider
      throttles gnutella traffic. Try changing your gnutella port in the network
      settings of gtk-gnutella.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="gnet4">What does the stuff in the Flags column mean?</a></h3>
    <p>You can see the type and some of the settings of a connection here. Note
      push-proxies are implemented in 0.92.1c and later.</p>

    <h3><a name="gnet-user-agent">What's the meaning of a leading "!" in the
        User-Agent name?</a></h3>
    <p>This indicates that the User-Agent name is <em>possibly</em> faked but
      it could be a false-positive caused by a bad clock on either side.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="gnet5">What does "Harmful version banned, upgrade required"
        mean?</a></h3>
    <p>Sometimes, servents are discovered to have a bug or behaviour that is
      harmful to the gnet. For example, gtk-gnutella-0.92b had a bug that
      generated excessive queries which hammered on the GWebCache system. Such
      banning is exceptional, usually restricted to specific versions, and the
      servent's author is informed about the banning.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="gnet6">What does "Outdated version, please upgrade" mean?</a></h3>
    <p>It is important to upgrade versions of gtk-gnutella which are older than
      one year since they lack features that are important to the rapidly
      evolving gnet's health and scalability.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="gnet7">Why doesn't my HTTP proxy work?</a></h3>
    <p>Your HTTP proxy must support the method <code>CONNECT</code> because a
      normal <code>GET</code> doesn't work with Gnutella connections. This is
      an extension to the HTTP protocol and mainly supported by SQUID proxies.
      It's also often deactivated because it might be considered a security
      problem by your provider. At the moment, the proxy support - also for
      SOCKS - isn't very good. The developers don't use proxies but if you think
      you can fix it, we would appreciate your patches.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="gnet8">How can I increase the timeouts?</a></h3>
    <p>If your internet connection suffers from high latency it might help to
      increase the timeouts. Go to <em>File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;User Interface</em>
      and tick <em>Expert mode</em>. Now, you'll find a lot more settings to
      change when you go to <em>File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Gnutella</em>.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="gnet-auto">How does auto mode decide between ultra and leaf?</a></h3>
    <p>In order to be promoted to <a href="#general-ultrapeer">ultra mode</a>
      the following conditions must be met:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>There must be more than 8192 bytes/s outgoing bandwidth available.</li>
        <li>If bandwidth schedulers are enabled, leaf nodes must not be
        configured to steal all the HTTP outgoing bandwidth.</li>
        <li>If Gnet out scheduler is enabled, there must be at least 256 bytes/s
        per gnet connection (ultrapeer or normal aka legacy).</li>
        <li>Overall, there must be 32 bytes/s per configured leaf plus 256
        bytes/s per gnet connection available.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3><a name="gnet-cache">I am running as ultrapeer, why GTKG keeps struggling to reach the maximum number of connected ultrapeers while the number of connected leaves is steadily close to 100%?</a></h3>
    <p>
        There could be mainly two reasons for such behavior: 1) there is an overall shortage of ultrapeers on Gnutella network, 2) you are experiencing outgoing connection problems. The latter is the more likely explanation. When running as ultrapeer, many leaves try to connect to you. Similarly, a relatively smaller number of ultrapeers is trying to connect to you. Also, you are trying to connect to other ultrapeers but not to leaves. If your outgoing connection is poor (saturated bandwidth, provider having problems, etc) you will be unable to connect to some ultrapeers, so their IP addresses is removed from your local ultrapeer host cache. Probably you also noticed that in the cache page the regular host cache gradually reaches its maximum, while the ultrapeers hosts cache is much emptier and sometimes the number of nodes decreases instead of increasing. Actually there is not much you can do. Try to reduce the number of concurrent connections and/or the number of ultrapeers and leaves connection slots; alternatively run in leaf mode.
    </p>
    
    
<h2>Searches</h2>

    <h3><a name="search0">How can I get more results?</a></h3>
    <p>The number of results you get depends heavily on whether people are able
      to connect to you (see <a href="#gnet1">port forwarding</a>) and on the 
      <a href="#gnet0">number of connections</a> to other hosts.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="search-entry">Where did the search entry box go?</a></h3>
    <p>Searches are now entered in the <q><em>Search:</em></q> box in the
      sidebar.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="search-passive">What are "Passive" searches?</a></h3>
    <p>A <q><em>passive</em></q> search will return all the search results
      that pass through gtk-gnutella. By filtering these results, passive
      searches can be useful.</p>
      
    <p>If you are in <a href="#general-ultrapeer">ultra</a> mode, many search
      results are already passing through your node besides the ones for your
      own searches. You can take advantage of this to make searches without
      generating any extra gnet traffic. For example, on my ultrapeer with 200 
      <a href="#general-ultrapeer">leaf nodes</a>, I opened a passive search and
      filtered the results to display only hits with the name <q><em>linux</em></q>.
      Within an hour or so I had about 1500 results. Obviously, the more popular
      the search, and the more patient you are, the more useful this technique
      is.</p>
    <p>If you are in leaf mode, then the only search results that will pass
      through gtk-gnutella will be those from your own searches, so the above
      technique won't be useful. But there is another way to use passive
      searches that is only useful in leaf mode. For example, if you start a
      passive search and filter it to display only mp3 files, then all mp3 files
      from all your open searches will be conveniently aggregated in one search
      window. By opening more passive searches with different filters, you can
      display different file types in each.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="search-local">How can I copy the magnet link of a file I'm
        sharing?</a></h3>
    <p>Do a search with the <code>local:.</code> keyword. The "." is a regular
      expression, which here matches any file -- this will give an exhaustive
      listing of your library. Then select an entry, right click and copy the
      magnet to the clipboard.</p>
      
    <h3>Downloads</h3>
    <h3><a name="down0">What does the status "Ignoring requested [SHA1|name
        &amp; size]" mean?</a></h3>
    <p>This means that gtk-gnutella has that file recorded as complete in its
      database. This database is usually located in <code>~/.gtk-gnutella/done.sha1</code>
      and <code>~/.gtk-gnutella/done.namesize</code>. At the moment, there is
      no way to remove or modify an entry of that database from the gui, but you
      can edit the file with any text editor while gtk-gnutella is not running.
      If you add or remove something from one of the files, do the same to the
      other.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="down1">What does the status "No URN on server" mean?</a></h3>
    <p>This means that gtk-gnutella wants to download a new file from a host,
      but that host does not provide a SHA1 hash for the file. Since the file is
      new (not yet partially downloaded), gtk-gnutella cannot do an overlap
      check to verify that the file on the host is really the file you want. In
      such a case it relies on the SHA1 provided by the remote host, but if no
      SHA1 is supplied, then gtk-gnutella has no way of assuring that the file
      it wants to download and the file on the remote server are really the
      same.<br>If you get annoyed by those messages you can activate the <em>Optimistic
        first chunk</em> option in <em>File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Downloads</em>
      (first you'll need to go to <em>Settings-&gt;Preferences-&gt;User
        Interface</em> and tick <em>Expert mode</em>).</p>
        
    <h3><a name="down2">Why is the same file downloaded X times?</a></h3>
    <p>Check the <em>Range</em> column. This is called <a href="#down3">swarming</a>.
      gtk-gnutella tries to get the file in <a href="#down4">chunks</a> and
      will get it from multiple hosts in parallel, if possible.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="down3">What is "swarming"?</a></h3>
    <p>Swarming describes the ability to download a single file from multiple
      hosts in parallel. gtk-gnutella will automatically try to find additional
      sources for any queued file using the <a href="#down5">download mesh</a>
      and by monitoring routed results.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="down4">What is a "chunk"?</a></h3>
    <p>A <em>chunk</em> is another word for <em>part of a file</em>. When
      gtk-gnutella runs in <a href="#down3">swarming mode</a> it will retrieve
      multiple chunks of a downloading file until it has downloaded the complete
      file. The <em>Range</em> column shows you which chunk you are currently
      downloading.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="down5">What is the "download mesh"?</a></h3>
    <p>When you download a file from a host that supports the download mesh, it
      will tell you about additional sources for the requested file (provided it
      knows of any). Those will then be used for <a href="#down3">swarming</a>.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="down_push">What is a "push request"?</a></h3>
    <p>The <em>push request</em> is a facility to download files from hosts
      you cannot connect to directly (because they are firewalled). Well, you
      cannot connect to those hosts, but they probably can connect to you. To
      tell a remote host to connect to your host so that you can download a file
      from the remote host you send a push request to it.<br>If you download a file using a push request and you loose contact to the
      host which originally returned the result for that file to you, then the <em>push
        route</em> is lost and you can no longer download this file. Therefore
      push routes are quite fragile. You can't make use of push requests when
      you are behind a firewall (see <a href="#gnet1">port forwarding</a>).</p>
      
    <h3><a name="down7">Why does gtk-gnutella append a .OK to my file names?</a></h3>
    <p>You probably haven't set up different directories for downloaded files,
      temporary files and bad files.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="down8">I got a file that just won't download!</a></h3>
    <p>If you don't see a smiling yellow icon with sunglasses in the statusbar,
      you should try to change that. See the section about <a href="#gnet1">firewalls</a>.</p>
    <p>Otherwise if gtk-gnutella says it has only a few sources for the file
      (best seen in the fileinfo subtab in the downloads pane) then this can
      have two reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the file is a rare one</li>
        <li>You selected a version of the file that is unique. Chances are that
        there may be a more common version. A file can become unique e.g. when
        somebody changes the mp3info on an mp3 file or otherwise does some
        custom modification to the file.</li>
    </ul>
<p>You can try to search for the file again and see if you find another
      version which is more common. It's usually a good indication if the "#"
      shows a number for a file. The larger the number, the better are the
      chances that you can get it quickly.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="down9">In the downloads pane, what does it mean if the color of
        the text is grey instead of black?</a></h3>
    <p>It means that the file is received over a <a href="#down_push">push
        route</a>.</p>
        
        
    <h2>Uploads and Sharing</h2>
    
    <h3><a name="up0">What does "Normalized" mean?</a></h3>
    <p>This shows the total amount of bytes uploaded for the file divided by
      the file size.</p>
      
    <h3><a name="up1">Why not all files within the shared folders are being shared?</a></h3>
    <p>By default Gtk-Gnutella shares only the files whose extension is included in the <em>Search extensions</em> 
    below the shared folders list in the Preferences. If your files are not being shared, probably their extension 
    is not included in that list. There are 2 ways to solve this issue:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>include the extensions of the unshared files in the <em>Search extensions</em> list;</li>
        <li>replace the whole list of extensions with the wildcard "--all--".</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Please note that you can check which files are being shared locally on your host by doing a search with the 
    wildcard "local:".</p>
      
      
    <h2>GTK+ 2.x</h2>
    <h3><a name="gtk2_ctype">Non-ASCII characters show up as _ (underscore).</a></h3>
    <p>Set the environment variable <code>LC_CTYPE</code> or <code>LC_ALL</code>
      to an appropriate value for the encoding you use. For example, if you use
      special German characters in your filenames, set it to <code>de_DE.ISO8859-1</code>.
      The valid values depend on your operating system, see the manpage
      setlocale(3) for details. Ideally, everyone would use UTF-8 encoding which
      covers nearly all languages.</p>
