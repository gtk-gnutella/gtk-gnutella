# since last version

- (2002.05.18 - RAM)
  * Improved shutdown code to avoid segfaults in grace period and deny all
	pending Gnet connections cleanly.
  * Moved pong-caching code to pcache.c.
  * Reorganized the way we detect that BYE was sent, and added support for
	probing the size of the TX stack.
  * Pay attention to GUI settings for bandwidth limitation before enabling
	the corresponding schedulers: only do so when they explicitly wish
	to limit traffic (provided allocated bandwidth is >0).

- (2002.05.17 - Richard)
  * Fixed bug: drag in queue while queue is freezed unfreezes queue.
  * Reflect freezeing of queue in the gui (as would explicit freezing).
  * Reduce min value for listen_port to 0 in glade.
  * Display notice window when shutting down.
  * Made menu expand and used gtkpaned so size of sidebar can be changed.
    Size is not yet persistent.
  * Removed stream button from search panel since unused.
  * Tried to fix problem with segfault during shutdown and thus
    disabled timer calls in main timer for things that were
    already closed (uploads/downloads) during grace period.
    Failed miserably because we still have a segfault.

- (2002.05.17 - RAM)
  * Applied enum/macro cleanup patch #555837 [From Uros Bizjak].
  * Display download queue status entries.
  * Fixed guess_local_ip() to never replace a previous non-private IP with
	a private one.
  * Added exit grace period to make sure final BYE messages get a reasonable
	chance of being sent.
  * Added extended copyright notices, per FSF recommendations.
  * Added copy of the GPL in the LICENSE file.

- (2002.05.16 - Richard)
  * The position of the divider in the downloads pane is persisitent.
    Attention: I implemented the missing gtk_paned_get_position function
    and it has the same name as the GTK2 function will have.
  * Started to tidy up config file
  * Hopefully fixed sourceforge bug #555758: Crash when drag lasts too long?
    Catch the drag signals and freeze the queue during drag. This prevents
    items to be removed from the list during the drag which I think was
    the cause for the crash.

- (2002.05.15 - Richard)
  * Fixed bug with spinbuttons: manually entering a value did require
    to hit enter two times or did not work at all. Had to use
    connect_after() to connect the signals.
  * Save width of "Status" column added to queue.
  * Display notice in the statusbar if the address has changed.
  * Added gNet traffic display and reworked the View menu and stats
    display a little
  * Replaced the hosts_in_catcher entry with a progressbar.
  * Changed some limits on the new configuration items.
  * Obsoleted all *bps* config variables and replaced them with
    *bws* counterparts to reflect the internal changing of names
    within bsched. Kept code to load the values from the *bps*
    variables though.
  * Added configuration of gNet bandwidth control

- (2002.05.14 - Richard)
  * Added lots of config stuff.

- (2002.05.14 - RAM)
  * Added traffic compression ratios.
  * Added support for Gnet bandwidth limiting (core only, no GUI settings).
  * Fixed flow-control problems on TX stack.
  * Fixed assertions on search sending to account for initial random hop count.

- (2002.05.12 - Richard)
  * Added "Status" column to queue. Not working properly yet.
  * Added icon to display "firewalled" and "not firewalled"
    status in statusbar
  * Change spinbutton support from using int to using float.
  * Fixed decimal values in the bandwidth settings
  * Unselect all before using regex to select (more intuitive)
  * Updated debian/substvars: added depends on zlib1g

- (2002.05.12 - RAM)
  * Removed debugging warning on Z_BUF_ERROR when TX flushing.
  * Search stats configuration unit is now the second.
  * Fixed assertion failure in deflate_rotate_and_send(): the culprit
	was deflate_nagle_timeout(), calling that routine without checking.
  * Added Debian build dependency on zlib1g-dev (in debian/control).
  * Compressed node traffic indicated by TXc and/or RXc in Info field.
  * Fixed typo in cq.c that caused hash bucket chaining to be mixed up.
  * Fixed order in the CH_INSERT_AFTER macro that was corrupting tail too
    early (forgot it was a macro, and not a function call).
  * Made destruction of the RX stack a true depth-first operation.
  * The RX inflater will stop delivering packets as soon as RX is disabled.
  * The TX deflater writev() routine was not accurately detecting flow-control.
  * Need to dispose of the RX stack asynchronously, not on the interrupt stack.

- (2002.05.11 - Richard)
  * Added a saftey call to disable the tabs of notebook_main even
    if left on in glade.
  * Added "local node" information to the main nodes display.
  * Added boxes around the queue and downloads frames, so the vpaned
    scales better.
  * Changed "Remove all matching regex" to "Select all matching regex".
  * Renamed some config variables and widgets to get better naming
    consistency.
  * Changed "Listen port" and "proxy port" to spinbuttons.
  * Added "Enable autoselect" to search panels. This binds to the
    search_pick_all config variable.
  * Made missing checkbutton states persistent.
  * Added some macro magic to gui.c, config.c and callbacks.c. More readbility,
    less writing effort.
  * Moved updating of gui widgets at startup from config_init() to
    gui_update_all().
  
- (2002.05.11 - RAM)
  * Allowed "configure --enable-no-rfc1918" to default to off (was forced on).
  * Exported bsched_disable().
  * Re-architected RX stack.
  * Added first support for Gnet traffic compression (still some rough edges).

- (2002.05.08 - RAM)
  * Ensured no line is longer than 80 characters in main.c and gui.c.
  * Dynamically setting bandwidth to 0 prevented all traffic instead of
	disabling bandwidth limiting.
  * Even if bandwidth scheduler is disabled, go through the EMA computation
	of the bandwidth actually used, for GUI display purposes.
  * Added Roles section to the AUTHORS file.

- (2002.05.07 - RAM)
  * Now that local_ip is persistent, we need to refresh it regularily in case
    it changes from one invocation to the other, and not always trust its
    persisted settings.
  * Changed "Shutdowning" -> "Closing".

- (2002.05.07 - Richard)
  * Added "Remove all matching regex from queue" to downloads panel
    (case sensitivity is not persistent yet)
  * Fixed memory leak in dialog-filters.c regex handling code
    (g_free(re)).

- (2002.05.04 - Richard)
  * Added "Max uploads to single host" to uploads panel
  * The usual cleanup of spacings and labels and stuff I came across
  * Added preliminary designs of a new filter dialog to the glade
    file. No functionality yet. Will probably be redesigned before
    actually being integrated.
  * Fixed bug: search field does not clear when search is added
  * Fixed bug: search tab headers do not update the result count
    properly when having "remove downloaded items from list" checked.
  * Fixed typo: "QUEUE FROZEN" instead of "QUEUE FREEZED"
  * Note: for autocompletition on a GtkCombo (e.g. search combo), try
    Alt-Tab. Works in any application.
  * moved more code from main.c to gui_init
  * removed clist_connections (old stats) from glade and gui code

- (2002.05.02 - RAM)
  * Fixed bug #551185: was not initializing local_netmasks_string.
  * Fixed bug #552255: could be wrongly freeing static string.

- (2002.05.01 - RAM)
  * Integrated the search queue patch: searches are now sent once every
	10 seconds on a per-connection basis [From Alex Bennee].
  * Was improperly counting duplicates as "bad" messages.
  * Now displays both dup/bad message counts in the Info column for nodes.
  * Searches now made persistent [From Michael Tesch].
  * Got rid of the local-config-file overwriting.  All configuration files
	are now exclusively saved in the config dir, never locally (unless you
	run from that config dir!).
  * Fixed bug #538946: was incorrectly moving complete files out of the
	done directory.  Also, "Nothing more to get" error is now reported if
	one tries to downloads a smaller file (it was not flagged as an error,
	so the "Completed" message was shown instead of the error text).

- (2002.05.01 - Richard)
  * fixed sensitivity of "copy url" in downloads popup
  * make search history work (though not persistent)
  * added "Remove downloaded items from list" checkbox to search panel
    Use this to have items selected for download automatically be 
    removed from the result list.

- (2002.04.30 - Richard)
  * Put statistics into a handlebox so they can be displayed seperatly
    from the main window
  * Went throught the gui layout and set a consistent layout style:
    horizonal spacing: 4; vertical spacing: 2; border: 2
  * removing of unnecessary widgets and more clean up of the widget
    tree
  * make "remove file" in downloads popup work
  * removed "abort and delete file" from downloads popup
  * made "copy url" really supply an escaped url which should work
    when pasted to a browser
  * changed the widget for entering search strings in the search panel
    from a GtkEntry to a GtkCombo as a preparation to supply a search
    history in future.
  * fixed sensitivity of several items in the downloads popup which
    were sensitive even if they would have done nothing when activated.

- (2002.04.27 - RAM)
  * Reversed logic for forced IP, to make it behave properly: the IP is
	now only updated dynamically when "force IP" is not checked.
  * Added download_remove_file() and download_file_exists().
  * Check for new "download_delete_aborted" condition in download_abort() to
	remove file when it is set.
  * Added debug logging of bad packets, to help diagnose why we receive
	bad packets from gtk-gnutella.
  * Made nodes.c compile on the Alpha, where varargs objects are different.
    (fixes bug #537460)

- (2002.04.25 - Richard)
  * moved more code from main.c to gui_init() in gui.c.
  * added checkbutton "Delete file on abort" to downloads panel. When this
    is on, aborting a download will also remove the associated file from the
    hard disk. This is to prevent us from having multiple "Abort..." and
    "Abort and delete..." entries in the popup menu.
    This functionality still has to be integrated into the download logic.
  * remove the "update" button for port configuration on the config network
    panel. This entry now behaves just like every other entry (enter or 
    change focus to accept changes).
  * replaced more entries in the config panels with GtkSpinButtons.
  * added a "copy url" item to the downloads popup. This can be used to 
    copy the url of a single download to the clipboard and paste it
    e.g. to your browser. This is only selectable, if a single download
    is selected.
  * added build_url_from_download() to misc.c because of the above
  * cleaned up lots of stuff in gui.c, including coding style but mostly
    changing the way focus-out signals were handled. Now a focus-out signal
    triggers a activate-callback on all widgets to update the program state. 
    Meaning, we no longer use "grab_focus(menutree)" to trigger a focus-out
    event (useless focus jumping). Instead when pressing "enter" on a widget,
    the change is accepted and the focus stays where it is.
  * more layout in the config panels.
	
- (2002.04.22 - RAM)
  * Always update actual bandwidth used, even when the scheduler is disabled,
    so that the GUI can display the current usage whether bandwidth is
    limited or not.
  * Removed useless SIG_Ignore() signal handling trap, just SIG_IGN them.
  * Ignore SIGXFSZ so that subsequent write() fail: if not ignored, that
	signal will kill the process.
  * Added debugging output for auto-downloads, and refactored list iteration
	bits to be more in line with the other uses.

- (2002.04.21 - Richard)
  * click on bandwidth stats to toggle display mode (normal/average)
  * added "authenticate to proxy" to network config. The associated
    config variable is called proxy_auth.
  * made bandwidth stats more readable

# change of changelog format to better accomodate multiple contributors.

- made reissue timeout spinbutton on search-pane wider. (Richard)
- made config pane a tabbed pane. (Richard)
- added bandwidth control to config pane. (Richard)
- added support for temporary statusbar messages (Richard)
- reorganized configuration pane (made a tabbed pane) (Richard)
- added gui controls for changing bandwidth allocation in the config
  pane. (Richard)
- added indicators for current bandwidth allocation to left panel.
  (Richard)
- now really use statusbar contexts and the GtkStatusbar stack features.
  (Richard)
- Moved freeze toggle-button out of the context menu and display a
  message in the statusbar to warn the user that the queue is freezed.
  (Richard)
- added several new popup menu items to popup-download and popup-queue,
  but disabled them for now since they are not backed up by code yet.
  (Richard)
- removed useless host catcher popup code (Richard)
- added "freeze" toggle button to queue context menu. This can be used to 
  enable/disable the automatic moving of files to and from the queue
  (i.e. disable download_timer). To make this work properly, the
  download timer is the only function now to call download_pickup_queued.
  (Richard)
- added "kill all named" and "kill all from" to popup-queue and popup-downloads.
  These will remove all queued downloads and abort all active downloads
  matching any of the selected items. (Richard)
- visually distinguish items in search list that where already selected for
  downloading (Richard)
- Added uptime of servent to statusbar. (Richard)
- Modified multiple-selection handling in on_button_uploads_kill_clicked,
  on_button_downloads_queue_remove_clicked and on_download_start_now_activate.
  This should fix problems where the selection was not actually acted on.
- made popup_queue_start_now (de)activate correctly when maximum
  number of downloads is reached (Richard)
- Missed out to hide notebook tabs after modifing the gui. 
- Rearranged widgets to reduce minimum window size. On my box this means
  604x503 (sorry 640x480 guys... maybe later). 
  Enabled both scrollbars on nodes list
  Closes #540610 (Richard)
- Changed lots of stuff on the gui layout (Richard)
- Changed menu from list to tree (Richard)
- Renamed lots of widgets (Richard)
- Fixed several popup action handlers to cope with multiple selections 
  (Richard)
- Can add searches from the monitor pane (only if monitoring is off, because
  otherwise the selection would be gone too fast).
  (Richard)
- Replace numeric text fields (like max no of downloads) with a spinbutton
  (Richard)
- Disable autoselection when more that one file is already selected (search).
  (Richard)
- Hidden old stats frame (Richard)

- Added progress bars to display connection/upload/download stats (optional)
  (Richard)
- Made build-glade target in Makefile really regererate the code from the
  gtk-gnutella.glade file by calling src/Makefile glade_files
  (Richard)
- Updated Debian's control file.
- Now accounts for bytes transferred in interrupted uploads as well, and in
  particular at servent shutdown time.
- When not sharing, return HTTP error 503 instead of 410, since it is a
  server-side problem, not a client-side problem.
- When facing an HTTP/1.1 request, make sure there is a Host: header.
- Added routines for on-the-fly bandwidth settings, and access macros for
  getting the instantaneous and average bandwidth usage per second.
- Refactoring of network TX layer.
- Display the uptime as either "HH:MM:SS" or "d HH:MM" with blinking ":".
- Optionally favor local Gnet hosts over remote ones, per netmask [Mike Perry].

# v 0.85   2002.04.04  [stable]

- Changed bzero() into memset() in sockets.c for Solaris [patch #538619].
- Hidden useless gnutellaNet stats window.

# v 0.85   2002.03.30  [beta2]

Summary of changes (user-visible):

- Portability fixes.
- Memory leak fixes.
- Was moving to wrong pane when "jump-to-downloads" enabled.

Detailed changes:

- Define SOL_TCP as IPPROTO_TCP for non-linux machines.
- Added a return to shut up compiler warnings in bio_sendfile().
- Fixed memory leaks in queue.
- Shutdown TX side of socket after having sent Bye.
- Fixed memory leak in uploads, in push request handling (bug #534434).
- Was moving to wrong pane when "jump-to-downloads" enabled
  (bug #535000, with fix from Steven Walter).
- Increased receive buffer size for nodes from 48K to 112K.
- Fixed node_sent_ttl0(), which assumed node was kicked-out when Bye is sent,
  although it is no longer the case, unless Bye was already sent.
- Will now report error 414, "Requested URL Too Large", when encountered.
- Could mistakenly report 404, "Not Found" when rebuilding library.

# v 0.85   2002.03.23  [beta1]

Summary of changes (user-visible):

- Now support Gnutella traffic prioritization and flow-control for enhanced
  stability of connections.
- Can now use an HTTP proxy for outgoing connections, in addition to SOCKS
  v4 and v5 proxies.
- When "Force local IP" is ticked, gtk-gnutella will try to automatically
  update the value if it detects a change in your IP address.
- Added search statistics.
- Added persistent upload statistics, keeping track of which files were
  uploaded by users, and how many times.
- Will now show the size of the uploaded file and the requested range,
  under the form "request @ offset" in the Range column.
- Node servent names are now displayed in the gnutellaNet window, if known.
- Bandwidth management for input and output traffic is now possible.  It can
  only be configured via the config file though, not via the GUI.  It only
  accounts upload/download traffic, not Gnet traffic.
- Displayed transfer rates are now instantaneous transfer rates, not average.
- Upon completion, uploads and downloads show the time spent in transfer.

Detailed changes:

- Node send queue is now managed as a real queue.
- Added node transmission flow control.
- Routing decisions and actual routing are now two distinct operations.
- Some download control hardwired constants were made config parameters.
- Fixed downloading policy to avoid retrying ad infinitum when the connection
  cannot be made at the TCP/IP level (because there's nothing listening).
- Added support for the Bye packet.
- Dispatched heartbeat timer routines to the relevant files.
- Integrated HTTP proxy patch [From Szabolcs Seláf].
- Properly handle Range requests such as "123-456" and "-567".  Still no
  handling for things like "123-456,457-789" though.
- Extract and log vendor information of nodes we connect to.
- Fixed improper counting of TX-dropped packets in flow-control as RX-dropped.
- All % completion figures now shown with 2 decimals.
- Since we can now automatically determine our IP correctly, make sure the
  "force local IP" parameter is true by default.
- Could be sending pongs with TTL=0 by mistake.
- Was always sending pings with TTL=1 by mistake.
- Initial take at bandwidth management -- can only be configured via the
  config file, i.e. once and for all.  Gnet traffic does not count.
- HTTP error code 408 is retryable.
- Include Date and Last-Modified headers in our HTTP success replies.
- Switched to real-time download/upload transfer rate and ETA computations.
- Fixed number of columns in search table to 5.
- Fixed bug in handling node_bye() for ponging-only connections (#518822).
- When current transfer rates are too low, switch to average rate for
  estimating time remaining.
- More cleanup in the routing code, which fixes a potentially harmful bug.
- Ensure original downloads are saved in downloads.orig, and protect against
  sudden death whilst saving.
- Turn on TCP_CORK for uploads, to optimize outgoing bandwidth.
- Makes use of sendfile(2) if available.
- Huge cleanup in routing.c: function renaming, signature changes, assertion
  cleanup and comment additions.  In particular, removed a wrong assertion,
  known as "m->nodes" when failing.
- Trace user interface, OS type, OS version and CPU type in User-Agent.
- In the "Config" page, show total size of files shared.
- Adapted proxy_connect() signature to be able to get it to compile on IRIX.
- Now detects and handles the situation wereby time goes backwards or forwards
  due to time synchronization (NTP deaemon).
- Display the time spent uploading or downloading when entry is completed.
- TCP reception buffer is raised to 112K for downloads.
- The default node queue size is now 96K (150% of 64K, the max message size).
- Added support for higher-priority control messages.
- Node statistics now show amount of messages in queue, and percentage of
  the send queue filled with messages.
- Alive pings are now replied to with a higher priority pong.
- Tuned flow control to avoid too many memory allocation/free, and saturation
  of the queue (lowered high watermark to 50%).
- Now also emits the Remote-IP header when connecting to other nodes.
- Node statistics are now updated once per second on the GUI.
- Added Morpheus (MRPH) to the list of vendor codes.
- Fixed bugs #524773, #524987, #523762, #524988.
- Added Size/Range columns to the upload screen.
- Added Vendor and protocol Ver(sion) columns in the node screen.
- The GUID of a servent is now made persistent and flagged as such, in order
  to prepare the possible implementation of gnet: URLs.
- Factorized generation of random numbers into random_value().
- Added search statistics pane [From Michael Tesch, patch #524921].
- When "Never send a push request" is ticked, don't bother showing results
  from explicitely firewalled servents.
- Disable the "Start now" menu entry if we don't have any more download slot.
- Removed broken support for computation of lower-cased directory paths in
  the shared library.
- Fixed broken recursive scan of the library, with help from Michael Tesch.
- Ensure we do not launch two copies of gtk-gnutella backed by the same
  configuration, and protect any configuration change made whilst the
  program was running by saving a copy of the old configuration if needed.
- Fixed push bug, by allowing several downloads to be recorded for the
  same (index, GUID) tuple.  This can happen if we don't notice a re-indexing
  on the remote host.
- Fobid the multicast IP range, and also the new 169.254/16 private range.
  Downloads at those addresses will be pushed.
- Don't remove queued downloads whose size is greater than the one we completed.
- When downloading a file bigger than the one in the done directory,
  and provided it's on the same filesystem as the tmp directory, move it out
  for resuming.  This is safe now that we perform range overlapping.
- Changed error message "Route lost" into "Push route lost".
- Don't abort with "Push route lost" when we only fell back to push, but the
  address does not seem to be private and there was no push indication in the
  query hit.
- Added upload statistics pane [From Michael Tesch, patch #529294].
- Attempt to flush upload statistics on a regular basis when changed.
- Try to flush queued messages on nodes as fast as possible by turning
  on TCP_NODELAY to disable Nagle's algorithm.
- Reworked on the shutdowning/bye code to maximize chances of proper delivery
  of the BYE indication.
- Must duplicate filenames in uploads in case library is rebuilt, or it will
  corrupt the upload statistics.
- Save config and host cache in a temporary file first, then rename as the
  final file when everything is OK to avoid corrupting precious data via an
  incomplete write.
- Be sure to disable a queue becoming empty in mq_clear() if it was enabled
  (fixes bug #530811).
- Split I/O vectors larger than the max allowed size (fixes bug #530106).
- Fixed off-by-one error in url_escape_cntrl() causing memory corruptions.
- When needed, must disable reading before calling node_bye(), in case we're
  facing a temporary "ponging" connection, which node_bye() happily removes
  (fixes bug #531167).
- Now handle parsing of 0.6 handshake headers on Ponging connections, to grab
  any Node: header and fake a pong.  This also allows Ponging 0.6 hosts to
  be seen in the GUI: they used to be discarded very early in the process,
  making display impossible.
- Was mistakenly displaying last offset as size in uploads.
- Negative range requests are offsets from the end of the file.
- Added upload stats "average count" [From Michael Tesch, patch #533257]
  (will convert existing stats to the new format).
- Ensure minimum value for node_sendqueue_size (1.5 * max packet size).
- Fixed cornercase, a leftover of bug #530811.
- Fixed crash when upload stats are cleared (bug #533904).

# v 0.80   2002.01.31  [stable]
# v 0.80   2002.01.22  [beta2]

- Fixed I/O memory leaks.
- Fixed filter memory leaks.
- Fixed ping/pong counting memory leaks (in obsolete code anyway).
- At end of download, also remove "Retry in 10s" entries bearing same name.
- Now makes accurate use of the HTTP "Connection:" header.
- Don't try to open local "config" directory as a file.
- Improved the download selection logic on pushes.
- Be sure to reinstall the SIGPIPE signal handler within the handler
- Fixed bug in header parsing when NUL is the first char on the line.
- Stop filling our Query Hit packets when we reach our own max size limit.

# v 0.80   2002.01.19  [beta]

Summary of changes (user-visible):

- Download queue made persistent: your pending downloads will be saved and
  resumed the next time gtk-gnutella is started.
- The download queue will now show the Host information.
- Pushes now work correctly, and gtk-gnutella can also serve push requests to
  others, so people behind firewalls may now share as well.
- Search results filtering has been implemented: until now, there was only
  the GUI part without any real work done.
- Sorting by host now works on search results.
- Supports the 0.6 handshaking protocol, both for incoming and outgoing
  connections.  Still accepts 0.4 incoming requests, or issues 0.4 outgoing if
  the remote node does not appear to support 0.6.
- Ping/pong traffic is now limited to a few hundred bytes per second on each
  connection, lowering the bandwidth usage: you should be able to open more
  connections than before for the same bandwidth used.

Detailed changes:

- gtk-gnutella.spec now generated at configure time. [From: Sam Varshavchik]
- LimeWire shut down their router.limewire.com pong cache.
- Trace IP of HTTP requests/replies we send or receive.
- Check for valid index/name combination before checking for upload slots.
- Automatically and silently ignore 0-byte files in search results.
- Silentlently ignore files located in private IPs if we don't send pushes
  (this is a temporary hack until someone adds a radio button to achieve this).
- Detect changes in indices for files we already found, and update the
  download queue accordingly (patch from Vladimir Klebanov).
- Improved hex dumping routine and use it to dump data on connection problems.
- Don't send user/password to proxy if none was configured
- Assume we're firewalled and advertise so until we get an incoming connection
- Try to parse all extended Query Hit Data (the open part) assuming BS compat.
- Started to reorganize GUI/callbacks in search.c, moving relevant code to
  callbacks.c and gui.c.  There is still a fair amount of mixing between the
  GUI stuff and the program logic, requiring further fine tuning.
- Rewrote NUL detection logic in search query, and now dumps yet unhandled
  extra query data.
- Constant refactoring: moved download/upload/socket constants and state
  inspection predicates into their respective headers.
- Now scan uploads for timeouts, and added configuration of the various
  time limits via two new config variables: "upload_connected_timeout" and
  "upload_connecting_timeout".
- Proxy connection errors were not reported (show_error() was not implemented).
- Now parses HTTP headers correctly.
- Handles HTTP "HEAD" requests correctly.
- Handles Gnet handshaking at the 0.6 level.  All handshakes are now made at
  the 0.6 level, and upon failure, retried at 0.4.  As for incoming
  connections, both 0.4 and 0.6 are supported.
- Cancelled uploads are now logged with details, since they don't appear
  in the GUI currently.
- Mark upload/download as stalled if no I/O within the last minute
- The amount of seconds between two automatic re-queries of the network
  now has to be at least of 300 seconds.
- Fixed memory leak in uploads (found by Nate).
- Connection statistics now show two figures, as "x/y": x is the amount of
  connected sockets, and y is the amount of attempts made in the background
  but not yet fully connected at the application level.
- Node connections statistics are dumped for debugging.
- Downloads now use the new HTTP header parsing code.
- Don't hammer host caches, allow a reasonable delay between two consecutive
  connection attemps to the same host.
- Now uses fresh pongs when the saved caught host list has been re-read.
- Send 10 fresh pongs to old 0.4 servents to whom we deny the connection.
- Sent Pushes now use the Gnet connection socket, so they will work when
  behind a masquerading+forwarding firewall with only the Gnet port opened.
- Fixed a couple of buglets introduced by the late re-organization of code.
- Added handling of push requests sent by remote servents, i.e gtk-gnutella
  will now reply when others request us to push a file to them.
- If search results say remote servent is firewalled, start immediately in
  push mode when downloading, provided pushes are authorized.
- Recognizes more vendor codes in QHD (Query Hit Descriptor).
- Implemented LimeWire's ping/pong reducing scheme.
- Created doc/gnutella directory, populated with reference on the recently
  implemented algorithms.
- Fixed index-updating bug for downloads in push mode: the mapping was
  not updated correctly, resulting in a failed assertion later on.
- Advertise "Pong-Caching: 0.1" in the 0.6 handshake reply.
- Factorized creation of version string, in a "version_string" global
  that is now used everywhere the name of the program and its version needs
  to be output in a header (User-Agent and Server headers).
- Forgot that search reissue timeout of 0 meant "no reissue".  Fixed, and
  adapted the label text in front of the entry textarea.  Also enlarged
  the area a bit.  [From: Nate]
- Fixed IP/port setups for socks4 and socks5 proxies: now use network order
  instead of native. [From: Robert Bihlmeyer]
- Was not validating config variable `min_dup_ratio'.  Adapted its comment,
  and made other cosmetic change to the config file output.
- Now initializes version string once and for all, at main() time.
  This string is then consistently used in all emitted headers.
- Parses remote "Pong-Caching:" hanshaking header.
- During download requests, force push immediately if the remote end's IP:port
  appears to be not connectible, even if the "Push" bit is not set in QHD.
- Created new "Stopped" state, which is used on retry-able error conditions,
  such as EOF or "Connection reset by peer" errors.  The retry timer was
  shortened from 60 to 15 seconds, awaiting to make it configurable.
- Detect and print as such a failed outgoing connection that sent us
  connection pongs nonetheless.
- Fixed improper trailer generation in query hits: the last flag byte was
  not copied at all.
- Suppressed md5 from the source, it's no longer used.
- Refactoring in routing logic, mainly for push packet handling.
- Push packets are now routed correctly, and no longer widely broadcasted.
- Pushed downloads will abort when the route to the remote servent is lost.
- Forgot to detect TTL=0 pings in our new ping/pong handling logic.
- In case the handshaking fails with a remote strange server, read more data
  to be able to trace more of their reply.
- Now parses the Query Hit packets only once, no matter how many searches open.
- Integrated filtering patch [From Robert Bihlmeyer].  You may now apply
  filters to your searches.
- Double-clicking on a file in the search window will request downloading
  of the selected files. [From Noel T.Nunkovich]
- Removed useless and memory hog host catcher list in the gnutellaNet screen:
  saves 2 MB of RAM plus avoids cost of updating it [From Mark Schreiber].
- Be tolerant on servents that do not send a Content-Length but send
  a proper Content-Range line instead (which we tolerantly parse as well).
- Accept searches even though we might not be connected to the net yet
  [From Mark Schreiber].
- Added Host indication in the download screen [From Mark Schreiber].
- Fixed buglet in has_same_active_download() where "waiting" downloads
  were not considered when looking for duplicates, which could lead to
  assertion failures for pushes later on.
- When not sharing, don't return query hits [From Mark Schreiber].
- When not sharing, send them a "410 Sharing currently disabled" error.
- Added X-Live-Since: to all our HTTP replies.
- Added download queue persistence.
- Download resuming now checks for proper file via an overlap of 512 bytes.
- Split hostcache into two distinct lists: the reserve, and the list of
  nodes we tried and are known to be valid Gnutella servers.  In an attempt
  to limit the tendency of the hostcache to remove hosts rapidly.
- Will now automatically determine that the forced local IP is obsolete
  and change it on the fly, provided we're connecting to modern servents,
  which make use of the Remote-IP header during handshaking.
- Compute IP address of public hostcaches once, to avoid many long DNS lookups.
- When low on hosts in cache, collect "semi-pongs" from Query Hits
  (an idea from Mike Green).  The "low" threshold is 12.5% of maximum.
- Added URL escaping routines.
- Now supports URL-escaped requests, but still sends un-escaped requests to
  remote servents.
- Advertise our node address/port using the Node: header on all outgoing
  handshakes.
- Minor reformatting of config file comments, and raising of default max
  messages to be more tolerent on replies, whilst reducing greatly the max
  size of queries to limit potential of abuse.

* v 0.12          2000.05.03

- All C++ style comments have been replaced by C style comments
- Incoming connections are now accepted again (lame bug created in 0.11 fixed)
- Slashes are replaced by backslashes in downloaded files names
- Downloaded files are no more created before we actually receive data for them
- Queued downloads can now be reordered by drag and drop
- Queued downloads can now be started at any time (using right mouse button on
  them)
- Active downloads can now be forced to push mode, moved back to the queue,
  or killed (with the output file removed) using right mouse button on them
- Preferences and configuration are now saved in a directory instead of a
  single file. You can choose the path of the directory to be used by setting
  the GTA_GNUTELLA_DIR environment variable before running gtk-gnutella.
  By default it will be ~/.gtk-gnutella/ 
- Estimated TR (Time Remaining) is displayed while downloading files
- Catched hosts are now saved in clear text in a separate file:
  GTA_GNUTELLA_DIR/hosts
- Catched hosts can be imported from and exported to any text file (using
  right mouse button on the gnutella host catcher)
- Gtk-Gnutella should now compile (using gcc) and run on more processors
- A few memory leaks removed, but some remain (I don't know where yet)

  search results list (GTK doesn't seem to handle well auto sorting)


* v 0.11          2000.04.19

- Sizes of files in the gnutellanet stats, in search results and in downloads
  lists are now displayed in B, KB, MB or GB. By the way, the gnutellanet
  stats will display the right number of shared bytes...
- Search results can now be sorted by File name, Size, or Speed.
- Buttons 'abort selected', 'resume selected' and 'clear completed' in the
  download section should be less randomly active / unactive.
- The numbers of active and completed downloads should be more accurate.
- The number of routing errors should be more accurate too.
- Some warnings about malformed packets have been removed (that happens too
  often to be displayed...)
- Do not allow more than one incoming connection from the same IP, to prevent
  connect flood attacks (Somebody tried to establish more than 32 simultaneous
  connections (from the same IP) to my client today...)
- Catched hosts are now saved, and reloaded next time Gtk-Gnutella is started.


* v 0.1           2000.04.16

- First release of Gtk-Gnutella :)
