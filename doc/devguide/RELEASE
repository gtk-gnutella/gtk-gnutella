Quick Release Guide
====================

[The whole process will take ~1 hour]

Checking steps
--------------

Before releasing, double check that:

* The keys have been updated for the major release, in src/core/token.c,
  with the date (timestamp) listed in the token_keys[] array being accurate.
  Generate new keys with this:

	dd if=/dev/urandom | od -x | awk '{
		printf("\t\042%s %s %s %s %s %s %s %s\042,\n",
			$2,$3,$4,$5,$6,$7,$8,$9) }' | head -n 28

Release steps
-------------

0. Make sure everything is up to date, since we're releasing based on
   local files:

	cd "top directory"
	git pull --rebase origin
	cd extra_files
	make update			# updates geo-ip.txt

	cd "top directory"
	tx pull				# Pull translations from Transifex

	# If the above "tx pull" did not work, then do:

	tx pull -f
	cd po
	make update

1. Write user summary of changes since last release in ChangeLog.

2. Mark toplevel entry in ChangeLog as being the release:

   # v 0.91   2002-10-19  [stable]

   Highlight of changes (user-visible):

   - Change #1.
   - Change #2...

2a. Update the version number at the top of src/gtk-gnutella.man

   Check the man-page to see if there are any user-visible changes such
   as command line options that must be described there.

3. Edit src/gtk-gnutella.h and setup for the release:

   #define GTA_REVISION "stable"
   #define GTA_REVCHAR ""
   #define GTA_RELEASE "2002-10-19"

4. Update debian/changelog. Generate the timestamp as follows:

	TZ=UTC LC_ALL=C date +'%a, %e %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z'

5. Make sure MANIFEST doesn't list any files considered unfree by Debian,
   for example, RFCs and other copyrighted documentation.

6. From the "top directory", run:

	git diff > ~/tmp/xxx

   Look at the ~/tmp/xxx file to see whether there are still uncommitted
   changes that require to be checked-in before the release is made.
   Commit them if needed.

7. Commit pending changes with comment such as "Release 0.91 stable."

	git commit -a -m "Release 0.91 stable."

8. Merge back to the master branch and tag project with a PGP signature:

	git checkout master
	git merge --no-ff -m "Release 0.98.3 stable." devel
	git tag -s -m "Release 0.98.3 stable." v0.98.3

9. Make a clean distribution package:

	cd "top directory"
	makedist -q -c gtk-gnutella-0.97.1
	cd gtk-gnutella-0.97.1
	./scripts/git-version.sh >version

   This will generate a directory gtk-gnutella-0.97.1 and include the
   proper version file.

10. Create the tar.xz and detached ASCII signature

	tar -cvf gtk-gnutella-0.92.1.tar gtk-gnutella-0.92.1
	xz -v9 gtk-gnutella-0.92.1.tar
	pgp -sba gtk-gnutella-0.92.1.tar.xz

11. Move into the directory.

	cd gtk-gnutella-0.92.1

12. Build the debian package:

	fakeroot debian/rules binary

	This will generate file ../gtk-gnutella_0.92.1-0_i386.deb

13. When everything builds fine, publish the new release:

	 git push origin
	 git push --tags origin

14. Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-gnutella/files/ and
    create a new directory gtk-gnutella/0.96.9 (say) to host the
	released files.

15. Upload the files to sourceforge using scp, or use the web interface
    to upload the files through HTTP.

16. Click on the file information for the .xz file, and make it the new
    default download.

17. Go back to the Summary page and check if the project details are
    still up-to-date. In particular check the set of languages
    available in the distribution against the listing with:

	 cat po/*.po|grep 'Language-Team:'|sort

18. Update sourceforge's website: Create a news entry in htdocs/files/en using 
    news_template as a guide and submit it.  The scripts/changelog2html
	script can automate most of this process:
	
	 scripts/changelog2html ChangeLog > htdocs/files/en/news_NUM

19. Change the VERSION file in htdocs/files to update the version number.

	VERSION=0.96.9

20. Manually update the web site by running the update_homepage.sh script
    from the htdocs directory:

	./update_homepage.sh USER

    where USER is your sourceforge login name.

21. Send a message to gtk-gnutella-announce telling about the release
    using Announce-template.txt

22. That's all folks!
