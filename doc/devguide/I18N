SHORT GUIDE ABOUT TRANSLATING MESSAGES
$Id$

1. INTRO
========

This is a short summary of the gettext documenation. See the
APPENDIX if this information isn't sufficient for you.


2. Extract the translatable strings from the source files:
==========================================================

 $ cd src
 $ xgettext --keyword=_ --keyword=N_ *.c *.h

You should now have a file called ``messages.po''. If you look
at the source files, you'll find many strings which are not
marked as translatable. The reason for this is that these strings
are only used internally or they are only interesting for
developers i.e., for debugging.


3. Prepare the POT file:
========================

Use your favourite editor and edit the first lines of 
``messages.po'' to match these:

"Project-Id-Version: gtk-gnutella VERSION\n"
"POT-Creation-Date: 2003-04-15 23:20+0200\n"
"PO-Revision-Date: YEAR-MO-DA HO:MI+ZONE\n"
"Last-Translator: FULL NAME <EMAIL@ADDRESS>\n"
"Language-Team: LANGUAGE <LL@li.org>\n"
"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"

Replace VERSION, YEAR, MO etc. with reasonable values. It's important
that you use ``charset=UTF-8'' as above. If your editor doesn't
support UTF-8 don't mind, you can convert that later.


4. Translate the messages:
==========================

You'll find something like this:

#: main.c:42
msgid "Hello world"
msgstr ""

If you want to translate to German, you would change the 3rd line
to the following:

msgstr "Hallo Welt"

Don't touch the string behind ``msgid''! If you find typos or
the like, this string must be corrected in the source file.
If you see a string with a ``%'' in it, then leave the part with
``%'' as-is and don't change the order of these ``words''.
Also keep the character after an backslash ``\'' as-is.
For example:

msgid "%-8s are %d time faster than %s.\n"
msgstr "%-8s sind %d mal schneller als %s.\n"

See man printf(3) for details about the syntax, if you have
problems with it.

You don't have to translate every message. If you cannot or don't
want to translate a message just leave ``msgstr ""'' as-is. Don't
copy the string of msgid!

 
5. Convert the output to UTF-8 (if it's not already UTF-8 encoded):
===================================================================

iconv -f CHARSET -t UTF-8 messages.po > utf8.po

Replace CHARSET by the one you use e.g., if your from Western Europe
it's probably ISO-8859-1. Otherwise see what echo $LC_CTYPE says,
and strip the part up to the . (dot). For example:

 $ echo $LC_CTYPE
 ja_JP.eucJP
 $ iconv -f eucJP -t UTF-8 messages.po > utf8.po


6. Install the POT file:
========================

First, verify that your POT file is correct:

 $ msgfmt --check --strict utf8.po -o output.mo

You should get no warnings but find a file ``output.mo'' which is
binary version of the ``utf8.po'' which will be installed by the
application during its installation.
 
Copy utf8.po with the appropriate name into the po directory:

The part before ``.po'' is simply the country code (ISO 3166). For
example, if you are from the Netherlands:

 $ cp utf8.po ../po/nl.po


7. Stay tuned!
==============

The messages may be changed from release to release and with growing
functionality there will be more messages that should be translated.
Thus, translation isn't something static. Every few month there will
be a few more sentences to be translated. 

8. Add localised keys to gtk-gnutella.desktop:
==============================================

The Name, GenericName, and Comment keys should be translated. The 
format is:

Key[locale]=localestring

For example:

Name[nl]=Gtk-Gnutella

Make sure the file stays UTF-8 encoded.
