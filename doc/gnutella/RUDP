Reliable UDP (RUDP) File Transfer Spec 1.03
===========================================

This is a converted version of the RUDP documentation provided by
Julian of BearShare. The original PDF document is available here:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/the_gdf/files/Proposals/Pending%20Proposals/F2F/Reliable%20UDP%20version%201.03.pdf


Packet Type
===========

There are five different RUDP packets. The RUDP packet header is a
Gnutella header with function field set to 0x41.  The RUDP packets
headers are saved in  the first 16 bytes of the Gnutella header (which
is normally the GUID field).   The five types are: SYN, ACK, KEEPALIVE,
DATA, and FIN.

enum PacketType {
	OP_SYN 	     = 0x0,
	OP_ACK 	     = 0x1,
	OP_KEEPALIVE = 0x2,
	OP_DATA      = 0x3,
	OP_FIN       = 0x4
};


Basic RUDP message definition:
==============================

struct UdpConnMsg {
	unsigned long peerConnID :8; // first 8 bits is peer's connection id.
	unsigned long data1Size : 4; // second 4 bits is data1 length. Only
                               	     // DATA packets use it.
	unsigned long opcode :4;     // third 4 bits is the packet type
	unsigned long seqNumber :16; // last 16 bits is sequence number.
};

The seqNumber should be incremented only after sending a DATA or SYN
message. Message retransmissions do not change the seqNumber.
Bearshare set data1Size to 0 except Data packet.


SYN
===

struct UdpSynMsg : UdpConnMsg {
	unsigned char connID; // the connID used in this connection
	unsigned __int16 protocolVersionNumber; // set to 0 for first version
};

Receiver of SYN should remember this connID, and set the
UdpConnMsg.peerConnID = this connID for all following packets.  Timeout
for SYN is 20 seconds. The initial sequence number is 0.


ACK
===

struct UdpAckMsg : UdpConnMsg {
	unsigned __int16 windowStart;  // Highest seqNumber received so far.
	unsigned __int16 windowSpace;  // this is reserved
};

ACK message's seqNumber is copied from the message it ACKs.    KEEPALIVE
Same as ACK, the only difference is its opcode is set to 0x2. 

Because UDP hole may close if no data passes, this message is used to
keep the hole open.   Bearshare will send KEEPALIVE if no data sent or
received in 10 seconds.  Bearshare will close connection if no message (
include KEEPALIVE  message ) received in 20 seconds.   DATA  

struct UdpDataMsg : UdpConnMsg {
	unsigned char data1[MAX_GUID_DATA];
};

MAX_GUID_DATA = 12, because GUID length is 16, and UdpConnMsg length is
4. So we can store 12 bytes of data in the header.  The data1Size in
UdpConnMsg defines how many of those bytes are valid. The Gnutella
header's length field defines total size of the payload.    Size of
Bearshare send packet:  1472 (UDP MTU for Ethernet and PPP)
-GNUTELLA_HEADER_SIZE + MAX_GUID_DATA - 40( compensate for PPP
encapsulations ) which comes to 1421 bytes.  

Bearshare will drop a UDP packet if its size > 4K bytes. Rules:

1) When out of order seqNumber was received, if it is 25 bigger than
   current received max in order seqNumber, it will be drop.  Otherwise it
   will be stored.  The timeout for Data packet is get from RTT. If no ack
   for the  packet is received, sender will re-send.

2) If retry 5 times still not get ack, connection will be dropped.

FIN
===

struct UdpFinMsg : UdpConnMsg {
	unsigned char reasonCode;
};

enum CloseReason  {
	REASON_NORMAL_CLOSE     = 0x0,
	REASON_YOU_CLOSED       = 0x1,
	REASON_TIMEOUT          = 0x2,
	REASON_LARGE_PACKET     = 0x3,
	REASON_TOO_MANY_RESENDS = 0x4,
};    

Connection sequence Suppose we have two nodes A and B. A tries to
download from B. The steps are: 

1)  A sends a push to B and at the same time A starts sending SYN
    messages to B, A will re-send the SYN message every 1 second until the
    connection is  established.
2)  B receives push, and starts sending SYN messages to A. B will also
    keep resending every 1 second until the connection is established
3)  At some point, the firewall for each node opens a corresponding
    hole. Both A and B receive the SYN sent by the other node.
4)  Both A and B send ACK to the SYN. Connection established.
5)  A and B send DATA messages to each other.
6)  A or B sends FIN, closing the connection. 


RTT
===

Only calculate the RTT of a data packet if we are receiving the first
ACK to the first send of the data packet. Otherwise, no RTT or cumulative
effect is recorded. Given a low failure rate of generally less than 2%,
this works  reasonably well. It could be an issue if the RTT was
shooting up during failures but if failures are occurring then
exponential backoff and such  should fix that situation.


Congestion Control Used by Bearshare
====================================

Congestion control is handled by the sender using its Sliding Window.
The window size determines how many packets can be sent and outstanding
(waiting for an ack) at any given time.   Basically, it is the same as the TCP
congestion avoidance algorithm.     A simplified description -
implementation details are left to the client:

1) Initial Sliding Window size is 5. Maximum size is 25.  Minimum size is 1.
2) Reduce Window when receiving out of order Ack. Increase Window when
   receiving in order Ack.
3) Reduce Window to 1 when retransmit.
4) Check send buffer queue size each second, reduce window when send buffer
   queue has data, increase Window when send buffer queue is empty.


Setup test 

Controlled test In order to setup a Controlled test environment, you
should have at least one of the following setups:

1)  2 computers with public IPs and firewall software installed
2)  2 computers with private IPs, each connected to a different router

Install 3 Bearshares or 2 Bearshares and 1 limewire. One Bearshare works
as UP, others work as leaves. None of them connect to Gnutella network.
Manually connect both leaves to the UP.    Make sure the two leaves run
on different machines and are totally firewalled.  Send a query from one
leaf that will return hits from the other leaf, and start a download off
of one of those hits.   In both Bearshare's upload and download list
views, you will see the host color is purple, meaning UDP connection.
In Bearshare, the Udplogic Console reporters show sending and receiving
udp packets.  DownloadStream, Upload Console reporters it is same as
before.  Uncontrolled test  Try to download and upload from Limewire
4.2.6, which supports firewall to firewall transfer.


LimeWire's Internal Documentation
=================================

Requirements for FW-FW Transfer:
--------------------------------
* You must be firewalled (no successful incoming connections).
* You must know your external address (snooped from Sockets for outgoing
  connections).
* You must be able to handle solicited UDP traffic (easy test: send out
  a UDP Ping with a certain GUID, see if you get a UDP Pong with that GUID
  back)
* You must have valid PushProxy connections (really only true for
  uploaders, but for sake of simplicity apply to everyone).

In the next few sections, some information may be repeated.

Client Side (Downloader) behavior:
----------------------------------

* If you meet the requirements above, nodes should mark bit 9 of their
  queries MinSpeed field.  NOTE: If you set bit 9, you must set bit 14 ("I
  am firewalled" bit).  Nodes that are also firewalled would usually
  ignore your query, but if they meet the requirements above and see bit 9
  marked they can now return a hit.
* Nodes (from firewalled hosts) that support firewalled transfers will
  send a GGEP header and value in their reply.  The GGEP header is "FW"
  and the value is the FW-FW Transfer version (currently 1).  Replies from
  firewalled hosts should be ignored unless this GGEP header is present in
  the reply.
* If a reply from a firewalled node is downloaded by the user, the node
  should send a PushProxy request to the node's (uploader's) PushProxy (as
  many as needed up to as many provided).  The PushProxy HTTP request
  should be amended to include a file parameter with value (2^31 - 3),
  i.e. "&file=2147483645".  Also, the HTTP exchange should have a "X-Node"
  header value of the downloader's external address and firewalled port.
* Assuming the PushProxy process was successful, the downloader should
  start sending UDP Syns (as described further below) to the uploader's
  address (which is taken from the reply).  If everything is kosher, it will
  get a UDP Ack in reply (and the transfer can start).

Client Side (Uploader) behavior:
--------------------------------

* If a node that satisifes all the FW-FW Transfer conditions receives a
  query with MinSpeed bits 14 and 9 marked, it may send a reply to this node.
* Any reply should satisfy the following constraints:
   - It must have a GGEP header "FW" with value 1.
   - The reply must have address and port info as follows: address is
     external address as reported by symmetric TCP connections, port must be
     your (firewalled) listening port.
* When the node receives a Push with index 2147483645 it should start
  sending UDP Syns to the address and port described by the Push.  If
  everything is kosher, it will get a UDP Ack in reply (and the transfer
  can start).

PushProxy behavior:
-------------------

* Proxies should not need to do anything different, assuming their
  initial implementation was sane (i.e. it should note the file param and
  should fill out the Push's address, port, and file index correctly).

[Notes from RAM]

The above specifications will not work correctly when initiating FW-FW
transfers behind a NAT firewall: there is no way for the sender to know
in advance the port that will be opened by the firewall to perform NAT
and be able to route traffic back to the sender in the internal network.

Therefore, using an HTTP push-proxy to send the request will not allow the
remote host (server) to know the port to which it must send a reply.  It is
NOT the port advertised in the X-Node header.  HTTP push-proxies are useless
there!

So here is what must be done: the PUSH MUST be sent via UDP to the push-proxy,
who MUST then recognize that the file-index refers to a FW-FW transfer.  The
push-proxy then patches in-place the message, using the port in the incoming
UDP message -- that is the port used by the NAT firewall, and only that port
will get traffic back to the downloader behind the NAT firewall!

Connection Negotiation and lifetime for UDP Connections:
--------------------------------------------------------

This is a brief description of the UDP connection setup at a low level with
some minor updates.  Note that this presupposes that the connections have
been kicked off on both ends via pushes/push-proxies and by the downloader
locally.

Each end of the connection starts out sending a SYN message to setup a
connectionID, identify itself and open up the firewall in the process.
There are dedicated ACK messages in response to every SYN, DATA or FIN
message.  FIN messages are for shutdown.  There is also a KEEPALIVE message
that shares some of the internal state of ACK messages (windowStart,
windowSpace but not the sequenceNumber of what they are Acking).

Everything is somewhat intellegently packed into a Gnutella message with
parts of the GUID used for data as well.   Everything has a sequenceNumber
which is physically sent on the wire as 2 bytes but logically and internally
mapped to 8 bytes.

The Data messages try to pack 512 bytes of data into a Gnutella message (12
in GUID and 500 in payload).  That seems to be enough to avoid
super-inefficiency.

The data transfer algorithm is sort of a combination of SFTP with some TCP
concepts added on.   For better throughput, a window is used to rate control
the data messages.  The current implementation works with a data window of 20
data messages.  The general idea is to try to send data at *intervals* so as
to ensure that you don't overload the other ends receiving window.  The
other end will ack these data packets with the sequenceNumber, windowStart
and windowSpace.  The windowStart tells you the lowest sequenceNumber that
the other side has not emptied out of its window.  Roughly speaking, as the
windowSpace starts to approach zero on the other end, you should slow down
and stop sending Data.

Example: The windowStart value is the value of the highest sequenceNumber
where every lower number has been received.   So, if I received: 44, 45, 47,
48, 49.  My ACK on 49 would have a windowStart of 46 until 46 was received.
If 46 did come in either via a resend or the original message then its
ack would have a windowStart of 50.  I use these values to ACK any lower
packets if necessary (without taking into account the timing of them).

SYN messages start off connections and communicate the desired identifier
(ID) for a UDP connection.  They use ID=0 until they have received
the ID desired by the other end of the connection.  It is important to the
LimeWire implementation that they start using the ID once received.
They also communicate the protocol version number.  IDs for established
connections are from 1 through 255.  They cycle so that an ID will not be
reused for a while to avoid ID collision problems from old connections.

   SYN  ID=0 SEQ=0 myID=1 V=1 ->
   SYN  ID=0 SEQ=0 myID=1 V=1 ->
   SYN  ID=3 SEQ=0 myID=1 V=1 -> [Repeated for up to 20 seconds
                                  until an ACK is received]
<- SYN  ID=0 SEQ=0 myID=3 V=1
<- SYN  ID=0 SEQ=0 myID=3 V=1
<- SYN  ID=1 SEQ=0 myID=3 V=1    [Repeated for up to 20 seconds
                                  until an ACK is received]

The connection is not officially set up until acks are returned from both
ends.

   ACK  ID=3 SEQ=0            ->
<- ACK  ID=1 SEQ=0

Once acks have been exchanged, data can be sent.  Note that with messages
sent, we use the other end of the connections desired connection ID.  This
can be true on some of the final SYN messages as well (after a SYN from the
other side is received but before an ACK is received).

   DATA ID=3 SEQ=1            ->
<- DATA ID=1 SEQ=1

<- ACK ID=1 SEQ=1
   ACK ID=3 SEQ=1             ->

....

<- FIN ID=1 SEQ=702 R=0
   FIN ID=3 SEQ=204 R=1       ->
   ACK ID=3 SEQ=702           ->
<- ACK ID=1 SEQ=204

FIN messages signal a connection shutdown.  They carry a reason code.  Zero
signals a normal close on the local socket.  One signals that the other end
closed the connection.  Note that each end maintains its own sequenceNumber
count.
