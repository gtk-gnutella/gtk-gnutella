This folder contains the specification documents that LimeWire
has published, extracted from their Wiki site.  It is not necessarily
reflecting what gtk-gnutella is implementing, especially when the
prose is referring to Java classes.

Also there are lots of incomplete information in the original
specs that will need to be clarified.
