Hi,

consider this a follow-up to the below mentioned thread:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/the_gdf/messages/8898

gtk-gnutella ( https://gtk-gnutella.sourceforge.io/ ) has been
extended to support IPv6 in current CVS. While it's working, it should
still be considered experimental. Therefore, the relevant new GGEP
extensions are only defined in the GTKG namespace:

GGEP "GTKG.IPV6"

  Carries a single IPv6 address [16 bytes]. This is used in all
  messages in which an IPv4 address may appear whether in a extension or
  directly.  If a mandatory IPv4 is zeroed out, this indicates that only
  the IPv6 address should be used. Otherwise, both addresses may be
  usable depending on whether the receiver has IPv4 and IPv6 support
  respectively connectivity. As a special case, a zero-length payload
  may be used to indicate support (including connectivity) for IPv6.

  [This has been obsoleted by the standard "6" --RAM, 2011-06-22]

GGEP "GTKG.IPP6"

  An array of <IPv6>:<port> in binary format. So far it is only used
  in pongs and serves exactly the same purpose as the UHC-related GGEP
  IPP extension.

  [This has been obsoleted by the standard "IPP6" --RAM, 2011-06-22]

Gnutella and HTTP headers

  Furthermore, all headers used by the Gnutella handshake and HTTP
  transactions in which IPv4 address may appear must be expected to
  contain IPv6 address as well. The human-readable format used for IPv6
  address is explained in defined in "IP Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing
  Architecture" [RFC 3513]. Zero-compression and the IPv4-mixed form
  make this a bit complicated to parse and to print. Related routines
  must be well-tested.

  Finally, URLs must be expected to carry an IPv6 address as host
  part. Since URLs may contain an explicit port number separated by a
  colon ':', the format of IPv6 addresses clashes with URLs. Therefore,
  IPv6 addresses must be embraced with brackets ('[' and ']') to prevent
  ambiguity. This is specified by "Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in
  URL's" [RFC 2732]. However, this problem is not unique to URLs but
  occurs also with <IPv6 address>:<port> pairs. Thus, this format using
  brackets should also be used in all headers in which IPv6 address are
  or may be paired with a port number.


DNS

  It might be required to change the routines used to resolve
  hostnames, if the current ones handle only IPv4 addresses. You will
  also have to decide at runtime whether the resolved IPv4 or IPv6 can
  actually be used due to missing IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity. DNS
  resolution requests should be issued to allow both IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses unless it is known respectively configured that the local
  peer has no IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity.


Uniqueness of Addresses

  Unlike with IPv4, in an IPv6 environment every end-user typically
  has a network range of of 2^32 - 2^80 addresses assigned to his
  account/site. This makes it more difficult to ensure fairness as a
  single peer could in theory use a huge amount of addresses. This
  should also be considered with respect to the diversity of the local
  host cache.

  When filtering certain IPv4 addresses, make sure IPv6 "aliases" are
  filtered as well. This includes IPv4-mapped addresses (::ffff/96) but
  also addresses under the 6to4 IPv6 prefix (2002::/16).
  IPv4-compatible addresses (::/96) might be considered as well but
  these are actually deprecated and are best ignored respectively
  discarded.


Getting IPv6 connectivity

  Many, probably most, ISPs do not provide IPv6 support at least not
  to end-users. There are two easy ways to get IPv6 connectivity
  nonetheless. The first is using a so-called "tunnel broker".

  Another and probably the easiest option is to use 6to4 routing. The
  latter does not require to sign-up for a IPv6 tunnel but simply
  support by the operating system respectively its network stack and a
  proper configuration. It is not required to know about a certain
  router or gateway that can be used, the anycast range 192.88.99.0/24
  is used for this purpose. A disadvantage of this solution is that the
  assigned range of IPv6 addresses is as stable or dynamic as the used
  IPv4 address. The relevant specifications are "Connection of IPv6
  Domains via IPv4 Clouds" [RFC 3056] and "An Anycast Prefix for 6to4
  Relay Routers" [RFC 3068].

  A third option is to use a HTTP or better a SOCKS5 proxy that is
  IPv6-capable. This is probably the least-desired solution but it does
  not require any kind of support by the operating system for IPv6 and
  for some people this might even be the only way to use IPv6.
