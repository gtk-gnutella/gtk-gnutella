1 Introduction
==============
1.1 Background
Gnutella servents transfer files to one another using HTTP.  This scheme
works so long as the servent hosting the file (the server) is accessible
by the servent downloading (the downloader) the file.  Increasingly it
is the case that servers are behind a firewall, and cannot be directly
reached.

The original Gnutella protocol has a workaround called Push.  With Push,
the downloader constructs and sends a Gnutella Push packet on the GNET
containing the down loader's address and port, as well as the server's ID.
If this message travels through the cloud and eventually finds its way
to the server, the server opens a connection back to the downloader,
sends a special header, then waits for the downloader to begin a HTTP
conversation on this open connection.

This Push mechanism works sometimes.  The problem is that the cloud
is too dynamic.  Intermediate hosts come and go, thus breaking the
path, and making it so that the Push packet rarely reaches the server.
This is exacerbated if the downloader must log off the GNET for any period
of time.  A second problem is that when the Push route is broken, the
downloader cannot tell if the server went down, or if the route was lost.
These issues result in frustrated users who see search results they
cannot download, and an underutilization of large numbers of resources -
machines that can't be used as servers.

This Push Proxy proposal outlines a technique to do away with these
problems, therefore increasing the likelihood that a downloader can
get content from a firewalled server.  This proposal does not address
the problem of a firewalled downloader attempting to get content from
a firewalled server.

1.2 Requirements
The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD
NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted
as described in RFC 2119. An implementation is not compliant if it fails
to satisfy one or more of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for
the protocols it implements. An implementation that satisfies all the
MUST or REQUIRED level and all the SHOULD level requirements for its
protocols is said to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies
all the MUST level requirements but not all the SHOULD level requirements
for its protocols is said to be "conditionally compliant".

1.3 Terminology
To understand this document, we use a standard set of terminology
throughout.  A Gnutella servent that is sharing files and that cannot
be directly reached by the bulk of nodes on the GNET (due to firewall
or other condition) is called the Firewalled Server or FS.  A Gnutella
servent that wishes to download from the FS and can receive incoming
connections is called the Downloader or D.  A Gnutella servent that is
used to proxy download requests is called the Push Proxy Server or PP.
Any Gnutella servent that has received an incoming GNET connection from
the FS is called an Ultrapeer or U (classical Gnutella servents can
become a PP as well).

2 Basic Operation
=================
The basic operational steps of the Push Proxy proposal are:
     1. The FS sends a vendor message to its ultrapeers asking if they will 
        take the responsibility of a push proxy.
     2. If it is willing to be a push proxy, the node (PP) responds with an 
        acknowledgement vendor message.
     3. When the FS constructs QueryHit packets, it attaches a GGEP extension 
        containing the endpoints for its push proxy servers.
     4. When a D receives the QueryHit and wants to download from from the 
        FS, it contacts the PP with a simple HTTP message, containing 
        information from a Gnutella PUSH message.
     5. If the PP still has an active connection to the FS, the PP takes the 
        information from the HTTP message, constructs a Gnutella Push message, 
        and sends it 1 hop to the FS.  Under any case, it returns an 
        informative HTTP status response code to D.
     6. When FS receives the Push message, it follows the standard Gnutella 
        rules for responding to a Push message, and contacts D with a GIV.
     7. PushProxy sources are propagated through a revised DownloadMesh syntax.


3 Firewalled Server (FS) asking for a push proxy
================================================
The FS sends the new PushProxyRequest message to its ultrapeers asking if they 
will become a PP.
 
3.1 PushProxyRequest Message
Selector: LIME/21v2
Payload: Empty.
VM GUID: 16 byte ServentId of the FS.

3.1 PushProxyAcknowledgement Message
Selector: LIME/22v2
Payload: 6 bytes.  The IP/Port the FS should use for this proxy server.
The format of the IP/Port is a 4 byte address followed by a 2 byte port.
The IP address is given because the proxy server may be multi-honed.
VM GUID: 16 byte ServentId of the FS, the same as sent in the
corresponding PushProxyRequest message.  All fields are little-endian.

4 Advertising ones Proxy Servers
================================
The FS must relay the endpoints of their PP servers to potential
downloaders.  This is done in Gnutella QueryHit messages, during HTTP
handshake headers during the download transaction, and through the
Download Mesh.

4.1 In Query Hits
=================
When a FS with a PP receives a query that it can answer (it MUST obey the
minspeed bits, as a firewalled downloader cannot download from a FS), it
attaches a new GGEP extension to the QueryHit.  The ID of the extension
is 'PUSH', and the payload is an array of IP/Ports of servers who are the
FS's proxies.  The format of the IP/Port is a 4 byte address followed by a
2 byte port.  The number of the entries in this array is PayloadLength/6.

4.2 In HTTP Handshakes
======================
During a HTTP session a FS MUST tell its downloader the most
up-to-date proxy information.  This is communicated via the new HTTP
Header 'X-Push-Proxies', whose format is a comma delineated list of
DottedIPAddress:Port combinations.  A servent that receives this list
MUST immediately replace its known list of proxy servers for the FS with
this updated list.

4.3 In Download Mesh
====================
The Download Mesh is a technique for conveying alternative
sources to a downloader.  The format of the original download mesh
(X-Gnutella-Alternate-Location) cannot accommodate the necessary
information.  A new format (X-Alt) used to transmit the push proxy mesh
information.  Support for Download Mesh is optional, and is described
in the Download Mesh 0.1 document.

5 Contacting a Proxy Server
===========================
A downloader sends a HTTP message to the FS via the FS's PP.

The downloader sends this message to endpoints of the PP discovered in 
section 4. 

The resource name is:

/gnutella/push-proxy?
	ServerId=<ServentIdAsGivenInTheQueryHitAsABase32UrlEncodedString>

The D MUST also include the X-Node header in this HTTP request.
X-Node: <IP>:<PORT>

The IP/PORT in the X-NODE header are those in which the firewalled servent 
should send a GIV.

Recommended responses to this HTTP Request are:

      202, "Push Proxy: Message Sent", 
           "Push Proxy: Your message was sent to the requested party."

      410, "Push Proxy: Servent not connected", 
           "Push Proxy: The servent specified in your request 
	    is not connected. Do NOT try again!"

      400, "Push Proxy: Bad Request", "Push Proxy: Request was malformed. 
            Do NOT try again!"

If the D receives either an error HTTP status code (i.e. >= 400) or no
response at all, it MUST not contact this PP again.

If the PP can give a positive response (status code=202), it SHOULD
service this request immediately.  If it cannot do so (it cannot spare
the bandwidth), it MUST also drop the GNET connection to the FS, as
this indicates it can no longer be the PP.  If it can respond, and the
PP still maintains an active connection to the FS, the PP constructs a
Gnutella Push packet (FileIndex=0) and directly sends this to the FS via
the GNET. Upon receipt of the Push message, the FS follows the typical
rules of the Gnutella Push packet.
